"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          ",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Running ', ' Shoes ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Sports ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Asia ', ' Time ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Walking ', ' ergonomics ', ' Sampling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Communication ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Physical activity scale ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' remote sensor ', ' prototype ', ' Data Collection ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Expenditure ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Goals ', ' sensor ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,MA-07,-0.05286990784691018
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment.

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           ",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7808779,R01NS041811,"['computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eels ', ' Anguilliformes ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Resolution ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' Evolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors ', ' Link ', ' implantable device ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industry ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Simulate ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animals ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' experience ', ' voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Subclinical Seizures ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Mediating ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' markov model ', ' Outcome ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,1249881,PA-03,0.04570038593369126

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.           We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"Interactive, Self-programming, AI System for Activity Monitoring of the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway.

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           ",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,8059576,R01NS041811,"['voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' Seizures ', ' Prevention ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Translating ', ' Evolution ', ' Drops ', ' Learning ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Collaborations ', ' Simulate ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Generations ', ' Genetic ', ' Refractory ', ' Mediating ', ' Feedback ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Clinical ', ' Characteristics ', ' Resolution ', ' Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' interest ', ' Techniques ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Process ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' novel ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Rodent Model ', ' insight ', ' Pattern ', ' Outcome ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Patients ', ' Measures ', ' Time ', ' Methods ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' in vivo ', ' experience ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Data ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Detection ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' sensor ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Grant ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' base ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Research ', ' Animals ', ' improved ', ' Event ', ' Devices ', ' programs ', ' Therapeutic ', ' In Vitro ', ' Algorithms ', ' Series ', ' Location ', ' Engineering ', ' Phase ', ' Technology ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Eels ', ' Anguilliformes ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Neurology ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Subclinical Seizures ', ' markov model ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Slice ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' Probability ', ' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors ', ' in vitro Model ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' neurosurgery ', ' implantable device ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Electrodes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,1244329,PA-03,0.04570038593369126
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and also persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium Care system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 3 million emergency intubations are performed in the US every year and failure rates can be as high as 50% (3-5). Success is highly dependent on how frequently the responder performs this life-saving procedure on humans (6). Brio Device, LLC, an airway management medical device company, is addressing the need to decouple the success of the procedure from the experience of the user with their ""smart"" intubation device which integrates anatomic structure recognition algorithms and visual guidance feedback with an articulating stylet. Brio's intubation device is specifically designed fo the needs of emergency responders, such as paramedics, emergency department personnel, code teams in hospitals and military medics, who often arrive at the patient first. The smart intubation device will reduce failure rates by providing the user with visual instruction of the correct path to the trachea as he places the endotracheal tube. The guidance software uses machine learning and computer vision algorithms to recognize the anatomy and determine the path to insert the tube. Ultimately, the intubation device will include both a guidance display on an LCD screen and an optical stylet that has single-axis angulation control of the distal tip. For the purpose of this Phase I study, a laptop or desktop computer will be used for the image processing and the guidance display that accompanies the articulating stylet. The long-term goal is to create a device that is compact, light-weight and portable to suit the needs of ambulances and hospital crash carts.  The hypothesis for this study is that by incorporating a video guidance display with an articulating stylet, inexperienced users will be more successful in correctly placing the endotracheal tube using this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. To achieve this goal, image processing and machine learning algorithms will be developed to recognize key anatomic structures in the airway. Software will also be developed determine the path the tube should follow and to display this information for the user. Finally, the efficacy of the device will be validated in airway simulation mannequins with medical students serving as the inexperienced users. Phase II will focus on integrating the guidance software, articulating optical stylet and display into a portable device with embedded hardware and software contained within the stylet handle. At completion of Phase II, the device will be ready for clinica trials and FDA testing.  Brio will enter the $20 billion airway market with its intubation device. Initial sales will begin with anesthesiologists who are early adopters of new technology to assist with difficult airways. Brio will market its product to ~327,000 clinicians who use intubation devices. The U.S. addressable market for emergency intubation is ~$900M for the 41,000 ambulances and 5,800 emergency departments and hospital code teams.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this SBIR Phase I, Brio Device, LLC plans to create and evaluate a device that improves the success rate of emergency intubations by coupling a smart guidance display with a user-controlled single-axis articulating stylet. Emergency intubations are often performed in challenging situations by personnel who do the procedure infrequently. Since failure rates are as high as 50% and approximately 180,000 deaths occur each year from failed pre-hospital intubations, a device is needed to provide visual guidance information to assist the users and increase their success rates in emergency situations.            ",Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation,8453607,R43HL114160,"['Algorithms ', ' Ambulances ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' cerebral death ', ' Coma Depasse ', ' Brain Dead ', ' Brain Death ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Critical Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Military Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Intubation ', ' Laryngoscopy ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mannequins ', ' Manikins ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Device ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Paramedic ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Sales ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Medical Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' windpipe ', ' Trachea Proper ', ' Trachea ', ' Destinations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' Tube ', ' image processing ', ' Laryngoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Visual ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' light (weight) ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' laptop ', ' endotracheal ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Instruction ', ' information display ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' commercial application ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' ']",NHLBI,"BRIO DEVICE, LLC",R43,2013,244710,MI-12,0.059756325069425145
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise.

"Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite major advances in pharmaceuticals and medical device technology, the ability to safely and effectively control blood glucose in patients with Type 1 diabetes has remained a recalcitrant challenge and a significant source of human suffering and economic cost. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), increasing effort has been focused on the development of artificial pancreas (AP) systems using CGM coupled with insulin pump via closed-loop control (CLC) algorithms. Integration of these disparate technologies and implementation in a commercial product has faced numerous challenges to date. TypeZero Technologies' objective is the commercialization of the robust and extensively tested Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) software platform and supporting technology into a commercial-grade device ""hub"" designed to organize and control a network of medical devices for the improved management of blood glucose in the context of Type 1 diabetes. The DiAs prototype has been extensively tested to date, and has generated over 24,000 hours of on- patient data. In numerous clinical trials, this technology has reduced dramatically the frequency of occurrence of severe hyper- and hypoglycemic events, reduced glycemic variability and improved patient's ""time-in-range"" (rate of euglycemia). DiAs and supporting technologies represent the core elements of a radically different treatment paradigm that integrates and maximizes the capabilities of existing and currently approved medical devices with a proprietary software platform and control technologies. The key characteristics of the TypeZero hub are:  "" Modular hub functionality residing optionally within and across available networked devices including the  patient's pump, meter, CGM, smartphone, or within cloud services;  "" Ability to accommodate any control strategy that is deemed optimal for a specific patient;  "" Inherently layered architecture, designed with an upward pathway of sequential module deployment;  "" Inherent safety, featuring a downward pathway of graceful degradation to a known system state in the  event of component failure; and  "" Local and Global modes of operation enabling the availability of certain processes and patient  interaction through the portable device; other services and remote monitoring of subject and system  state are available via telecommunication (e.g. 3G, WiFi, etc.). We envision that in the near future consumer electronics hardware equipped with appropriate software (e.g. DiAs) would gradually replace specialized CGM receivers or insulin pump controllers, merging into a single ultra-portable platform the functions of continuous monitoring, insulin delivery, and closed-loop control. In the near-term, we envision creating a dedicated hub controller that will host key functionalities of artificial pancreas as a critical step toward the future.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The persistent challenge of safely and effectively managing blood glucose levels in the context of Type 1 diabetes indicates the inadequacy of currently approved and available medical device technologies.

"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training. The statistical inference techniques developed can be applicable to genetic epidemiology, health economics, and bioinformatics.",SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications.

"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system.

"In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home. The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting. In-home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patient's health under real life conditions. Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care. Accurate in-home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely.  The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF. An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency (RF) signals between each other. As a person walks past the transceivers, their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device. Preliminary results using only 2 or 4 transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed. Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi-resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits. Specific aims in this proposal will 1) further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs, 2) research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base-board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics; a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi-person discrimination capability, and 3) perform preliminary in-home evaluations of the GaitRF system. Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics. We will evaluate the performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single-resident and multi- resident homes of seniors.  If successful, this new system has the advantage of being low-cost, unobtrusive, and easy to install, while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics. The system can be used as a stand-alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems. Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment.

"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation.

"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment.

"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Consumer Advocacy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industry ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Prosthesis ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Names ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Osteolysis ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Procedures ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Trust ', ' Nutritional Supplement ', ' Diet Supplement ', ' Dietary Supplements ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Surgeon ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' cost ', ' rapid detection ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Dislocations ', ' Arithmetic ', ' ']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,CA-33,0.04248933439426662
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Public Health ', ' radiowave radiation ', ' radio wavelength ', ' Hertzian Waves ', ' Radio Waves ', ' Running ', ' Saliva ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' perspiration ', ' Sweat ', ' Sweating ', ' Tattooings ', ' Tattooing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Urea ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Carbamide ', ' World Health ', ' Nafion ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Measurement ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' enzyme activity ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' bioelectricity ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' response ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Skin ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Radio ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Validation ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' saliva composition ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Consumption ', ' usability ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' real world application ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,MA-07,0.10676256847542645
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation.

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization. The team members with clinical expertise have been engaged in blood pressure trials in US, and have been working with leading institutions in India engaged in cardiovascular research. This proposal brings together their unique expertise and experience to innovatively address this challenging problem through a joint effort. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unmanaged hypertension is a major problem, and its management based on occasional measurement is known to be suboptimal.

"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Proteomics ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Source Code ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' learning network ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ubiquitous computing ', ' ']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,MA-07,0.053183494437101325
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9312420,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Baltimore ', ' Brazil ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Spectacles ', ' Eyeglasses ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Guatemala ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' India ', ' Institutes ', ' Mali ', ' Noise ', ' Optometrist ', ' Patient Schedules ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Refractive Errors ', ' eye refraction disorder ', ' Refractive Disorders ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Spottings ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Country ', ' success ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' Geometry ', ' faculty research ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2017,200225,MA-05,0.007730588269805292
"Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury ! ABSTRACT Significance: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as lack of voluntary movement, increased chance of pressure sores, problematic spasticity, loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function, and more physical impairments which result in a lower quality of life and lack of independence. Approximately 285,000 people in the U.S. have SCI with ~17,000 new patients added each year. Current treatment options include an array of electrical stimulation interventions or high-intensity fitness regimens, but all share one common limitation of being episodic in their treatment delivery. There is a compelling need for a treatment option that can be used daily, improves Activities of Daily Living (ADL’s), allows for in- home rehab and most importantly provides patient independence. Enabling technology exists, often proven in other medical device applications, that can facilitate the design of an upper limb orthotic system to deliver the functional performance required by SCI patients. The OlympEX Medical Actively Powered Exoskeleton (APEX) device can meet the functional movement requirements, will be designed for in-home use and be affordable to the user. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the APEX orthotic system will achieve clinically meaningful improvement in a SCI patient’s range of motion (ROM) capability to perform ADL’s and to perform upper limb rehab in an in-home setting. Preliminary Work: The APEX orthotic system will be the third generation of orthotic device system to be developed by OlympEX Medical. Generations 1 and 2 are passively powered device systems that have provided the OlympEX design engineering team experience with mechanical apparatus requirements to elevate an upper limb. Likewise, the team has developed capabilities in advanced materials for the body chassis for these devices. The APEX orthotic system evolves from these product platforms to introduce system features in device guidance and user control only obtainable with an actively powered system. Specific Aims: This project entails the APEX hardware/electronic architecture development and the acute pre-clinical evaluation of the system on N=3 patients to evaluate patient safety and device feasibility. In Specific Aim 1 we will design, fabricate and evaluate the APEX mechanical design with electronic architecture. A subset of the APEX functional arm movements will be developed to demonstrate feasibility in performing a limited number of high priority ADL’s. In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate the performance of this subset of ADL’s on 3 SCI patients. Success criteria will be Pass/Fail as evaluated by clinicians. In addition, an initial patient safety assessment will be completed. Safety factors including discomfort or pain before and after the fitting of the device and no uncontrolled arm movements will be evaluated. Together, these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of APEX device to guide arm movements required to complete ADL’s and therapeutic arm movements in an ambulatory setting. ! Project Narrative Those with cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) have reduced ability to voluntarily move and use their arms and hands which results in the inability to accomplish many activities of daily living. OlympEX Medical proposes to develop and test an active powered upper extremity exoskeleton to help people with SCI and other neuromuscular conditions with their upper-limb function and rehabilitation.

"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9371547,K23HD092626,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Audiotape ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Family ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mothers ', ' Ownership ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Stress ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatrician ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' irritation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Services ', ' pediatric department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' technology development ', ' trait ', ' Familiarity ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' digital media ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,167135,MI-12,-0.011248123512516936
"mHealth for Heart Failure: Predictive Models of Readmission Risk and Self-care Using Consumer Activity Trackers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over five million people in the United States. Occurrence of, morbidity related to, and hospitalization due to HF have serious financial implications. In 2009, HF had a direct cost of over $34 billion annually, the majority of which was due to hospitalizations. By 2030, HF total direct costs are predicted to reach $53 billion, and indirect costs are predicted to rise from $31 billion to $70 billion. Increases in costs are contingent on the increase in the aging population, making prevention of HF and care efficiency imperative. Fifty percent of readmissions due to HF are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as the driving factor. Results of telemedicine intervention studies to support adherence to self-care and improve HF outcomes are inconclusive. Past telemedicine interventions for HF have utilized an array of methods including: wireless sensors, telephone services, websites, and home visits from nurses. Structured telephone support has shown in some cases to reduce hospitalization, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients. However, patient adherence to telemedicine interventions is often low. This lack of adherence is due in part to the high treatment burden placed upon patients in such home monitoring interventions, which require them to engage in novel behaviors, including using new unfamiliar hardware and spending time meeting with home health nurses. The goal of this R01 is to demonstrate the following: 1) patients are more adherent with a home monitoring regimen when using minimally-invasive monitoring technologies, including wrist-worn consumer activity trackers; 2) a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen combined with novel predictive algorithms may be used to forecast hospital readmission; and 3) data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a baseline survey may be used to predict levels of adherence to the home monitoring regimen. Towards these goals, we will recruit 500 HF patients to participate in a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen. A novel mobile application will allow patients to monitor their progress, submit additional data, and receive adherence notifications. We will measure levels of adherence to the regimen, and use collected sensor data and known readmission events to create a novel hidden semi-Markov model that continuously predicts readmission risk. Predicting a patient's level of adherence will be performed with EHR data and a baseline survey using several techniques, including logistic regression and support vector machine models. The work outlined in this proposal will produce a set of foundational tools for performing home monitoring of HF patients. These tools will be adaptable for future studies of individually-tailored interventions, towards our ultimate goal of allowing patients to download an “app” from an “app store” that adapts to their individual characteristics and allows them to more effectively manage their disease.

This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phonation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Source Code ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ubiquitous computing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation tool ', ' annotation framework ', ' ']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,MA-07,0.053183494437101325
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,9115682,K23HL125982,"['Anesthesiology ', ' Charge ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Collection ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Frustration ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Physician Assistants ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' pressure ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' wasting ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' ventilator-associated pneumonia ', ' Work Ethic ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,198331,MD-07,0.05621410630075494
"Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease 1 Abstract  2  3 This is a Phase I SBIR proposal to develop a non-contact and non-invasive imaging device for assisting clinicians  4 in selecting the appropriate level-of-amputation (LOA) in limbs with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgeons  5 prefer to salvage as much limb tissue as possible during amputation to increase patient mobility while decreasing  6 morbidity and mortality. However, clinicians must balance this preference against the likelihood of primary wound  7 healing at a given level of amputation (LOA), which decreases with more distal amputations. There are no gold-  8 standard tests to aid clinicians in selecting the LOA in patients with PAD, therefore reported rates of re-  9 amputation in current practice are substantial. Up to 20% percent of above-the-knee amputations to 35% of 10 foot amputations require revision to a more proximal level. Furthermore, physician awareness of the risk for 11 re-amputation may lead to overly aggressive selection of LOA to more proximal levels in some cases. Indeed, 12 certain patients may receive amputations at a level more proximal than is necessary because their surgeon could 13 not confidently predict a high likelihood of healing at a more distal level. 14 15 In current practice, selection of LOA is determined qualitatively by clinical judgment of the surgeon using patient 16 history and physical exam. Others have developed quantitative tests that assess local microcirculation. These 17 technologies have not superseded clinical judgement. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is 18 developing an imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging with a machine learning algorithm 19 to provide a quantitative assessment of the healing potential of a selected LOA whereas current clinical 20 practice is only capable of qualitative assessment. 21 22 We have proof-of-concept of our technology’s ability to characterize microvascular blood flow changes in a 23 patient with critical limb ischemia. In this proposal, we intend to establish the utility of our device for predicting 24 the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA by demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepView assessment 25 on a large set of pre-amputation images. To this end we will conduct a Phase I pilot study for the use of our 26 device in predicting the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA. This clinical study will develop a data set 27 for training the algorithm, and deliver a clear demonstration of feasibility for completing the development on an 28 algorithm that has high accuracy in predicting the healing potential of the proposed amputation site. Following 29 this work, we will apply for a Phase II proposal intended to finalize algorithm training, validate the algorithm 30 developed in Phase I, and establish a successful regulatory and commercialization pathway. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease,9622035,R43HL142428,"['Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Elements ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' foot ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Ischemia ', ' Judgment ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Microcirculation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Wound Healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' success ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' wound ', ' commercialization ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' clinical risk ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' patient mobility ', ' ']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2018,196561,TX-30,0.05917353693789643
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Rest ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Privacy ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Agitation ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Family member ', ' Self Management ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' fitness ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' cost ', ' information display ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' walking pace ', ' walking speed ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' recruit ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' health assessment ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,485014,MO-04,0.01903197804822788
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment Project Summary This project addresses a critical need for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD). Advances in smartphone hardware, computer vision, and machine learning have enabled the possibility of producing smartphone-based cognitive testing applications able to collect electronic sensor data and transform it into highly informative phenotypes that can serve as early indicators of future disease progression. In this project, we aim to develop a revolutionary new smartphone- based cognitive testing platform, called CTX, that will enable the rapid development and deployment of smartphone-based tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion, subsample and compress the combined streams, and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and modeling. CTX will provide a high-level application development framework that will significantly reduce the time and technical knowledge required to produce a smartphone-based cognitive testing application by providing an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to simply declare what sensor data should be collected and when. The framework will handle all the details of collecting the sensor data, synchronizing it, and transmitting it to a back-end server. The API will also have a variety of other high-level features to facilitate development of cognitive test apps. To demonstrate the feasibility of our vision for CTX, in Aim 1 of this project we will develop the software framework, back-end server software and a prototype smartphone app to exercise and validate many of the platform's features. For Aim 2, we will develop three different tests for this app to test saccade (eye movement) latency, verbal recall, and wrist mobility, each collecting a different type of sensor data (video, audio, and inertial measurement). These tests were selected because their results have been been shown to be predictive of MCI. We will implement phenotype extraction pipelines that employ advanced signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision algorithms to extract the target phenotypes from the sensor data collected for these tests and demonstrate they operate with sufficient accuracy to replicate published experimental designs. Successful completion of this project will eliminate the need for expensive and cumbersome phenotype collection equipment (e.g., eye tracking stations) and create the possibility of generating data from which MCI onset can be predicted. Data collected in Phase II via these and other such tests will enable us to apply our machine learning expertise to produce models able to predict transition to MCI that are both sensitive and specific, transforming any smartphone into an MCI risk assessment tool available for at-home use by millions of people. Project Narrative This NIH Phase I project will address the critical need for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD) by developing a revolutionary new smartphone-based cognitive testing platform that will provide individuals with an ongoing status of their cognitive health. Doctors who are given access to the results of these tests will be able to monitor patients more closely and provide more timely diagnoses. By studying test results from many people, researchers may someday be able to identify patterns that can distinguish mild cognitive impairment from normative age-related cognitive decline.",Smartphone

"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9711194,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Baltimore ', ' Brazil ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eyeglasses ', ' Spectacles ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Guatemala ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' India ', ' Institutes ', ' Mali ', ' Noise ', ' Optometrist ', ' Patient Schedules ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Refractive Errors ', ' eye refraction disorder ', ' Refractive Disorders ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Spottings ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Country ', ' success ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' Geometry ', ' faculty research ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' ']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2018,99914,MA-05,0.007730588269805292
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9520535,R01MH111916,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Breeding ', ' Callithrix ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Marmosets ', ' Hapale ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' vocalization ', ' gaze ', ' limb movement ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' offspring ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' vocal learning ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Scheme ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' social communication ', ' human disease ', ' speech processing ', ' multimodality ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' optogenetics ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' human model ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,549425,MA-07,0.024981506771979325
"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9596236,R01HD094772,"['Adoption ', ' Amputees ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Environment ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Motion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' Play ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Walking ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Artificial Leg ', ' prosthetic leg ', ' Leg Prosthesis ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' exoskeleton ', ' exoskeletal ', ' success ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' orthotics ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Leg ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Measurable ', ' Motor ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' NIBIB ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' prosthetic control ', ' prosthesis control ', ' powered prosthesis ', ' Degree program ', ' Gait speed ', ' robotic control ', ' robot control ', ' human model ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2018,474602,TX-32,0.034492191623634164
"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Over weight ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Home ', ' Data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Weight ', ' Data Collection ', ' wearable sensor ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' Obesity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Eating ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Food ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' Goals ', ' Algorithms ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Reading ', ' Elderly ', ' Human ', ' Human Activities ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Suggestion ', ' Child ', ' Manuals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Generations ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Methods ', ' Time ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' design ', ' lifestyle data ', ' Food Intake ', ' Image ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' negative affect ', ' human disease ', ' Text ', ' Wearable Computer ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' experimental study ', ' digital models ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' diabetes ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' blind ', ' wearable device ', ' dietary ', ' Privacy ', ' Communities ', ' digital ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' effective intervention ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' neural network ', ' imaging ', ' Wearable Computing ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' designing ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' social role ', ' data processing ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Behavioral ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' experience ', ' Chest ', ' pilot study ', ' Performance ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' theories ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' mathematical model ', ' System ', ' Intervention ', ' Speed ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' Overweight ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' interest ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Malnutrition ', ' American ', ' Workplace ', ' Descriptor ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,PA-18,-0.057712224760840175
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9538823,K23HD092626,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Audiotape ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Family ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mothers ', ' Ownership ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Stress ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatrician ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' irritation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Services ', ' pediatric department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' trait ', ' Familiarity ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' digital media ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,167319,MI-12,-0.011248123512516936
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Beverages ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietetics ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Assessment ', ' Nutritional Assessment ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' weight maintenance ', ' obesity treatment ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,RI-01,0.02042591485364195
"A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants Ensuring access to clean water for generations to come will involve developing novel ap- proaches to determining the safety and composition of potable water that are practical and afford- able. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are three of the top priorities among hazardous substances commonly found at Superfund sites, as they are linked to health problems in people exposed to them in drinking water, yet the current real-time monitoring methods for these and other contam- inants are either extremely costly or nonexistent, making it difﬁcult to monitor water quality with high spatial or temporal resolution. QBiSci is developing a biosensor that uses synthetic micro- bial sensor strains that ﬂuoresce in response to speciﬁc toxins to continuously monitor water for contamination. The platform will substantially improve upon currently available technologies for toxin detection, making monitoring more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable. Speciﬁc Aim 1: To fully characterize three synthetic E. coli strains that speciﬁcally detect ar- senic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water stream. For a real-time sensor to be maxi- mally effective, it must be able to report accurate toxin concentrations in real-time. Focusing on three of the highest priority contaminants as a proof of feasibility, comprehensive data will be acquired to train a machine learning algorithm to be able classify real-world samples in real-time. Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop and train a classiﬁcation algorithm to recognize the type and amount of each contaminant present in a continuous water stream. The ability to analyze and interpret data in real-time from a constantly ﬂuctuating water source will require an extensive classiﬁcation train- ing effort. QBiSci's existing machine learning framework will be trained and tested using many contamination induction scenarios, ranging from sudden pulses to subtly varying concentrations. Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop a microﬂuidic cartridge system that reduces device complexity and enables sensor deployment with minimal intervention. QBiSci will develop a swappable car- tridge system using devices that are pre-loaded with biologically-stable strains and can simply be “plugged in” to the sensor platform to achieve repeatable results in a user-friendly manner. The development of a method for thermoplastic device fabrication will enable the more precise connections required for a cartridge clamping system that will require little operational expertise.  A successful outcome of this proposal will lead to a biosensor capable of real-time quantiﬁca- tion of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water input. A future Phase II proposal would focus on real-world performance evaluations of our sensors via deployment in areas of con- cern and comparison of our results to standard techniques as well as an expansion of the platform to detect other contaminants quantitatively and continuously. 1 Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country over 100,000 hazardous waste sites are so heavily contaminated that the un- derlying groundwater doesn't meet drinking water standards. While there is a wide range of toxins found at these sites, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are among the most common offend- ers, all of which have been linked to a variety of health problems ranging from cancer to dia- betes as well as behavior and neurological disorders. We are developing a customizable real-time biosensor that will enable contamination monitoring to become more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable and will facilitate improved management decisions aimed at reducing toxin con- centrations in the environment, tracking the progression of contamination plums, and targeting investments in remediation efforts. 1",A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants,9467134,R43ES028993,"['Algorithms ', ' Arsenic ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Health ', ' Investments ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Generations ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Clampings ', ' ground water ', ' groundwater ', ' Performance ', ' water quality ', ' drinking water ', ' microbial ', ' Biosensor ', ' biological sensor ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' superfund site ', ' Plum ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Plug-in ', ' user-friendly ', ' operation ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated water ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NIEHS,"QUANTITATIVE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,162205,CA-52,0.076412034411195
"A wearable device to detect opioid overdose and to prevent death Bioresp Technologies, Inc. proposes development of RespiLife, a new wearable device to to track physiologic data for early detection of opioid overdose and to relay data and the generated alerts to relevant caregivers for further intervention.

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers).

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9623369,R01NR016423,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Intelligence ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Rest ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Privacy ', ' Walking ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Agitation ', ' Family member ', ' Self Management ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' fitness ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' cost ', ' information display ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' health assessment ', ' Grain ', ' functional independence ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,598358,MO-04,0.01903197804822788
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Amputees ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Burn injury ', ' burned ', ' Burns ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' foot ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Ischemia ', ' Judgment ', ' Knee ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Privatization ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Wound Repair ', ' Wound Healing ', ' Measures ', ' Synthesis Phase ', ' Synthesis Period ', ' S Period ', ' S Phase ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Secondary to ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Soft Tissue Disorder ', ' Soft Tissue Disease ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' speech recognition ', ' member ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Diabetic ulcer ', ' diabetes ulcer ', ' Address ', ' Tissue Viability ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' wound ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' improved outcome ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,TX-30,0.02717325203570798
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Beverages ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Computers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Dietetics ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Assessment ', ' Nutrition Assessment ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' food consumption ', ' weight maintenance ', ' obesity treatment ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' Infrastructure ', ' dietary adherence ', ' diet adherence ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,RI-01,0.02042591485364195
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' learning algorithm ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,TX-17,0.004581682172521589
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices. The tools will be applied to various clinical tasks such as detection and prediction of seizure and arrhythmia and classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, aiming for more accurate diagnosis.",QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring,9771321,R01EB025018,"['Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Seizures ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' science education ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Limes ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' mathematical theory ', ' mathematics theory ', ' mathematics reasoning ', ' mathematics logic ', ' mathematic theory ', ' math theory ', ' Mathematical Reasoning ', ' Mathematical Logic ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' heart rate variability ', ' biological systems ', ' geometric methodologies ', ' geometry methods ', ' geometry methodologies ', ' geometric method ', ' signal processing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' student training ', ' Data Science ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' ']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,255543,PA-18,-0.0001961016166742046
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,9907480,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' internal clock ', ' body clock ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' relational database management systems ', ' database systems ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Moods ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' light treatment ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Agitation ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Measurement ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' circadian clock ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' ']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2019,1240470,CA-02,-0.02506321905540672
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Cannabis Smoking ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Nicotine ', ' Polymers ', ' Production ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Specificity ', ' Students ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Weaning ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Film ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Chemicals ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Country ', ' monitoring device ', ' vapor ', ' high school ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' vaping ', ' adolescent health ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,NH-02,0.04306763665021151
"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['Automation ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' biosensing ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Crystallization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' labile factor ', ' labile component ', ' Proaccelerin ', ' Factor Pi ', ' Coagulation Factor V ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor V ', ' AC Globulin ', ' Factor V ', ' Floor ', ' Fluorescence ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' stress protein ', ' Heat shock proteins ', ' Heating ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Kinetics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physics ', ' Printing ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' resin ', ' Plant Resins ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' thermoreception ', ' temperature sensation ', ' Temperature Sense ', ' Testing ', ' temperature receptor ', ' Thermoreceptors ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Thermometry ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' DNA analysis ', ' hyperthermia treatment ', ' hyperthermia therapy ', ' clinical hyperthermia ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' high temperature ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' melting ', ' Thermal Ablation Therapy ', ' thermal tumor ablation ', ' thermal ablation ', ' graduate student ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Q-Dot ', ' Quantum Dots ', ' Institution ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Microfluidic Analytical Techniques ', ' Microfluidic Analysis ', ' Microfluidic Analyses ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' prototype ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' biological systems ', ' operation ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' Hyperthermia ', ' Geometry ', ' improved outcome ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' organ on a chip ', ' organ on chip ', ' ']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,UT-03,0.014024678379997413
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9817043,R37CA242545,"['Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Goals ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' poor sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Notification ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' chemotherapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' common treatment ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,361184,PA-18,0.03826338730952797

"Remote vital sign and opioid overdose detection via a non-invasive wearable sensing patch PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Approximately 2 million Americans are living with an opioid use disorder, and in 2017, 17,029 people overdosed on prescription opioids. Opioids cause respiratory depression; however, fatal overdose usually occurs over a period of 1–3 hours, leaving a window of opportunity to intervene with the inexpensive drug naloxone, an opioid antagonist, that can reverse the effects of opioids, quickly restoring normal respiration rates. VivaLNK proposes to enhance the currently marketed Vital Scout wellness wearable sensing patch for use in people at risk for opioid overdose, by detecting physiologic indicators of an opioid overdose (slow respiration rate, low heart rate and low blood pressure), and the ability to send a potentially life-saving overdose alert, which could be received by an emergency contact/caregiver and hasten treatment with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Health monitoring emergency notification systems that can remotely monitor patient vital signs for indications of deterioration and send a potentially life-saving alert to emergency contacts/caregivers, have the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatal opioid overdoses in the US. The Vital Scout patch is already strategically positioned to monitor overdose parameters utilizing the built in ECG sensor to continuously register waveforms from which respiration rate, heart rate, heart rate variability, and activity are calculated. While several devices are currently being developed for overdose alerts, the Vital Scout is the only alert which has the potential to capture the three critical vital signs indicative of an overdose, and simultaneously monitor physical activity, providing additional context to the vital signs data. The vital signs collected by the Vital Scout patch are based on a machine-learning algorithm which we propose to further develop by the following specific aims: 1) Refinement and optimization of the Vital Scout to incorporate an overdose algorithm with an alert function by improving the sensitivity in order to detect lower respiration and heart rate indicative of a potential overdose. 2) Expand the sensing capabilities of the Vital Scout system to include blood pressure monitoring. The algorithm will be optimized using three volunteer cohorts (~20/ cohort) (i) healthy volunteers, (ii) elderly patients over the age of 65 (more likely to have low BP due to medically-induced hypotension) and (iii) low BP patients (represented by elite student-athletes). Data from these cohorts will provide the initial broad range of data for the machine-learning linear regression algorithm. We will assess whether these are appropriate designations for providing accurate blood pressure measurements, similar to what is seen within the opioid population. Meeting all of these goals will result in an enhanced Vital Scout that will be the most sensitive device for opioid overdose detection to remotely monitor the vital signs of people addicted to opioids and those at-risk for opioid overdose, including but not limited to, people with pulmonary disease or those taking antidepressants.

"A framework for developing translatable intelligent neural interface systems for precision neuromodulation therapies Despite advances in neuromodulation technology, therapeutic devices are often ineffective or have adverse side effects. Next-generation closed-loop neuromodulation systems will provide great potentials for improving the therapeutic outcome by sensing the neural states and adapting the neuromodulatory actions. These systems will provide powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms of treatment by elucidating the causal link between regulating the physiological states and the therapeutic or the behavioral outcomes. However, a lack of systematic approach to optimally control neurostimulation is a major barrier to fully utilize their potentials. Furthermore, the real-time implementation of advanced optimization and control algorithms requires powerful computing hardware that pose a major challenge for translating the effective neural interface systems into implantable or wearable devices with limited power supply. The proposed project is addressing these two problems by developing an open-source end-to-end platform, called NeuroWeaver, to design, test and deploy intelligent Closed-Loop Neuromodulation (iCLON) systems that automatically can learn the optimal neuromodulation control policies by interacting with the nervous system. We cast the problem of optimizing neuromodulation into reward-based learning where achieving the desired neural state or the therapeutic outcome represents a measure of reward for the iCLON system. We will use techniques from reinforcement learning and model predictive control to develop algorithms that enable iCLON systems learn the optimal actions to maximize their reward. Memory dysfunction is one of the most devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementia. We will develop the NeuroWeaver platform in the context of designing iCLON systems to induce good memory states in the hippocampus by closed-loop amygdala stimulation. Optimizing the memory- enhancing effects of amygdala stimulation will have immediate benefits to research on treatments for memory disorders. More broadly, the NeuroWeaver platform can be combined with a wide range of biological sensors and actuators to design intelligent closed-loop control systems for regulating physiological processes far beyond the proposed application in this proposal. Our proposed platform will have the potential to create an open-source ecosystem for collaboration between machine learning, neuroscience, and computer architecture communities as well as provide tools for further enrichment of the algorithms and broader utilization in the biomedical domain. The goal of this project is developing a platform for designing therapeutic devices with artificial intelligence to enable automatic optimization of neuromodulation for precision therapies.

"Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system with remote patient monitoring. DBS has become an established neurosurgical procedure with over 160,000 patients treated worldwide. DBS has been shown to improve Parkinson's disease (PD) patient quality of life, increase long term tremor control, reduce dyskinesia, and reduce hyperdopaminergic behavioral symptoms. Some of the most common complications associated with this procedure are injury caused by wire/lead tunneling, erosions or infections of the tunneled wires, lead failure/migration, and tethering of extension cables. None of the current solutions are leadless and allow for remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices in the body. Bionet Sonar's software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than RF waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) Reprogrammable wireless stimulation leads; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent DBS device that can be monitored by clinicians and provide feedback control to optimize therapy using remote continuous real-time data will lead to improved PD treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled deep brain stimulation, recharging and remote monitoring components using ultrasonic waves at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo, data and energy transmission for the systems during controlled stimulation of the brain. In vivo experiments in minipig models (n=3) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes using closed loop control based on real time electrical sensing. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet Sonar Inc. and the University of Louisville. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet Sonar system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored deep brain stimulation system will be developed using new core technology for the Internet of Medical Things. Ultrasonic wideband technology will be used to enable wireless communication and recharging of the different implantable elements, allowing for miniaturization and energy efficiency. This technology will not only improve the outcomes and healthcare economics of the Parkinson's disease patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other

"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",9847052,R44ES028656,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Cations ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Digestion ', ' Disinfection ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' lead poisonings ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' Michigan ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Water Supply ', ' Specialist ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Particulate ', ' meter ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' water quality ', ' hazard ', ' drinking water ', ' aqueous ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' rapid detection ', ' lead concentration ', ' Pb concentration ', ' lead contamination ', ' lead contaminated ', ' contamination to lead ', ' contaminated to lead ', ' Pb2+ contamination ', ' Pb2+ contaminated ', ' Pb contamination ', ' Pb contaminated ', ' nanosensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nano sensing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Data Analytics ', ' graphene ', ' service providers ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' well water ', ' ']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2019,565059,WI-04,0.043299774255952994
"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions. The project is expected to introduce a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) to Primary and Urgent care clinics and remote settings to allow improved medical outcomes and cost management of chronic diseases.",Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases,9778356,R43NR018631,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Automation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Decentralization ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Ear ', ' Environment ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Sounds ', ' Heart Sounds ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Throat ', ' Pharynx ', ' Pharyngeal structure ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physical Examination ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Self-reflection ', ' Self-Surveillance ', ' Self evaluation ', ' Self-Examination ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' respiratory ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' FDA approved ', ' urgent care ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Augmented Reality ', ' support tools ', ' invention ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' heart defect ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' computational intelligence ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Infrastructure ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' ']",NINR,"ADVINOW, INC.",R43,2019,149999,AZ-06,-0.006746653316308999
"Unravel the cellular biophysical dynamics of spatial constraint-induced membrane blebbing and 3D migration using a microfluidic platform and data-driven mathematical modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Plasma Membrane blebbing and the relevant three-dimensional cell migration are vital biophysical processes, which trigger some critical cellular events and are implicated in a wide range of disease. Despite the preliminary success in identifying a key gene pathway and characterizing the basic cell morphology, the underlying mechanism are still poorly understood, due to the lack of effective research platforms. It remains to be a key question how the blebbing transduce the cell environmental stimuli into the cell and drive the cell migration. We recently developed a microfluidic device for the study of blebbing and cell migration. This device recapitulates the native environment for blebbing-involved migration, while providing some unprecedented advantages for investigating the cellular biophysics. We also established a data-driven mathematical modeling framework to study the complex morphology of bleb-like protrusions. Based on our preliminary data and other previous studies, we hypothesize that it is through the polarization of sensory ion channels that the environmental stimuli induce polarized blebbing, which provides the driving force for the migration. To test the hypothesis, we propose to study the blebbing dynamics, using a novel experimental-theoretical integrated platform, which is based on the previously established microfluidic device and data-driven mathematical model. First, we will define the correlation and cause-effect relationship of blebbing dynamics and the cell motility. Then we will define the correlation of blebbing dynamics to ion channel activities and regulation of pathways. Finally, we will assess the influence of the environmental stimuli on the blebbing-related cellular behavior and molecular regulation. The outcome of this study will significantly enhance our understanding towards the role of PM blebbing in cell migration and, in the long run, promote the bleb-targeting therapy. The developed experimental-theoretical integrated platform will also serve as a valuable technology for other cellular biophysical studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Plasma Membrane blebbing, a fundamental and essential cell behavior that takes place in various cell types, can be induced by spatial constraint and drive cell motility in the three-dimensional environment. The proposed research uses a specialized engineering platform integrated with mathematical modeling to unravel the underlying physical dynamics and molecular mechanisms.

"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9696008,R01MH111916,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Breeding ', ' Callithrix ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Marmosets ', ' Hapale ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Sleep ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' vocalization ', ' gaze ', ' limb movement ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' offspring ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' vocal learning ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Scheme ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' social communication ', ' human disease ', ' speech processing ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' optogenetics ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' human model ', ' microphone ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' automated analysis ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,521954,MA-07,0.024981506771979325
"Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose. Abstract More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdose in 2016 and drug overdose is now the most common cause of death for people under 50 years old in the United States. Furthermore, the number of overdose deaths is increasing with the rise of abuse of powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In May of 2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) directors Drs. Collins and Volkow outlined how research may help reduce the death toll associated with the current opioid epidemic; one of the current critical needs is the development of new overdose-reversal interventions, including wearable technologies that can detect an (impending) overdose from physiological signals to signal for help, or trigger a coupled automated injection of naloxone. Automated detection of overdose is essential because most opioid overdoses occur when individuals are alone and unobserved by family members or first responders. Opioids cause respiration to slow and become irregular due to mu-opioid receptor mediated suppression of respiratory related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. Importantly, there are characteristic early changes in breathing pattern that indicate a progression towards significant hypoventilation, but there is currently no easy-to –use method or device to measure these patterns non-invasively. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in respiratory monitoring using tracheal sounds. Tracheal sounds originate from the vibrations of the tracheal wall and surrounding soft tissues caused by gas pressure fluctuations in the trachea. These sounds can be collected from a microphone placed over the trachea and analyzed to determine the real-time respiratory rate and an estimate of respiratory flow and tidal volume. We hypothesize that individual trends in tracheal sounds detected by a machine- learning algorithm will provide an early warning sign of the onset of hypoventilation as a result of opioid overdose in humans. The aims of this proposal are to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose and to develop an initial design for a miniature wireless tracheal sound sensor. Project Narrative RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a non-invasive Tracheal Sound Sensor for early detection of impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose. The sensor will continuously monitor an individual’s respiratory pattern to detect a significant change from baseline, in which case it will contact a caregiver and/or emergency personnel detailing the location and status of the person experiencing an opioid overdose or initiate a coupled naloxone injection. This technology has the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths as a result of opioid overdose by allowing for the timely detection of hypoventilation and administration of naloxone.",Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose.,9680488,R41DA047779,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult

"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9702069,K23HD092626,"['parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Stress ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pediatrician ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' irritation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Services ', ' pediatric department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' trait ', ' Familiarity ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' aged ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' digital media ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Audiotape ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Family ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Hearing ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Sciences ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Mothers ', ' Ownership ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,167319,MI-12,-0.011248123512516936
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Motion ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Social Psychology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Measurement ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' treadmill ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,VT-00,-0.02249440826013557
"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.

"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10018621,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' body clock ', ' internal clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Moods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' light treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Measurement ', ' Earth ', ' Planet Earth ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian clock ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' appropriate dose ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2020,432887,CA-02,-0.02506321905540672
"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future. Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s affects millions of individuals, at a great cost to public health and personal well-being. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in- person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. This project will revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility limitations and enable personalized rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale using wearable sensing technology in the future.",Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation,9855893,P41EB027060,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Locomotion ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' coral ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' improved functioning ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' tool development ', ' evidence base ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' improved mobility ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' joint loading ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' biomechanical model ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' Data Science ', ' terabyte ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' societal costs ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' health goals ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P41,2020,1504632,CA-18,0.008860774304694494
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', ' Cannabis Smoking ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Nicotine ', ' Polymers ', ' Production ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Specificity ', ' Students ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Weaning ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Film ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Chemicals ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Country ', ' monitoring device ', ' vapor ', ' high school ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' High School Student ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' vaping ', ' adolescent health ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' JUUL ', ' ']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,NH-02,0.04306763665021151
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arteries ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Supine Position ', ' Dorsal Position ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' electric impedance ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' Sphygmomanometers ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' monitoring device ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Microfabrication ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' FDA approved ', ' sleep position ', ' non-prone sleep ', ' supine sleep ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' motion sensor ', ' advanced analytics ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' ']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,TX-17,0.04409595206164715
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9925236,R01HD094772,"['Adoption ', ' Amputees ', ' Ankle ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Tarsus ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Motion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' orthotics ', ' Play ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Walking ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Leg Prosthesis ', ' prosthetic leg ', ' Artificial Leg ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' exoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' success ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Leg ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' Motor ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' rehab research ', ' rehabilitation research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' NIBIB ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' prosthetic control ', ' prosthesis control ', ' powered prosthesis ', ' Degree program ', ' Gait speed ', ' robotic control ', ' robot control ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,446707,MI-12,0.034492191623634164
"A framework for developing translatable intelligent neural interface systems for precision neuromodulation therapies Despite advances in neuromodulation technology, therapeutic devices are often ineffective or have adverse side effects. Next-generation closed-loop neuromodulation systems will provide great potentials for improving the therapeutic outcome by sensing the neural states and adapting the neuromodulatory actions. These systems will provide powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms of treatment by elucidating the causal link between regulating the physiological states and the therapeutic or the behavioral outcomes. However, a lack of systematic approach to optimally control neurostimulation is a major barrier to fully utilize their potentials. Furthermore, the real-time implementation of advanced optimization and control algorithms requires powerful computing hardware that pose a major challenge for translating the effective neural interface systems into implantable or wearable devices with limited power supply. The proposed project is addressing these two problems by developing an open-source end-to-end platform, called NeuroWeaver, to design, test and deploy intelligent Closed-Loop Neuromodulation (iCLON) systems that automatically can learn the optimal neuromodulation control policies by interacting with the nervous system. We cast the problem of optimizing neuromodulation into reward-based learning where achieving the desired neural state or the therapeutic outcome represents a measure of reward for the iCLON system. We will use techniques from reinforcement learning and model predictive control to develop algorithms that enable iCLON systems learn the optimal actions to maximize their reward. Memory dysfunction is one of the most devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementia. We will develop the NeuroWeaver platform in the context of designing iCLON systems to induce good memory states in the hippocampus by closed-loop amygdala stimulation. Optimizing the memory- enhancing effects of amygdala stimulation will have immediate benefits to research on treatments for memory disorders. More broadly, the NeuroWeaver platform can be combined with a wide range of biological sensors and actuators to design intelligent closed-loop control systems for regulating physiological processes far beyond the proposed application in this proposal. Our proposed platform will have the potential to create an open-source ecosystem for collaboration between machine learning, neuroscience, and computer architecture communities as well as provide tools for further enrichment of the algorithms and broader utilization in the biomedical domain. The goal of this project is developing a platform for designing therapeutic devices with artificial intelligence to enable automatic optimization of neuromodulation for precision therapies.

"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10012013,DP1NS122038,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' next generation ', ' brain computer interface ', ' brain machine interface ', ' blind ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' learning behavior ', ' learned behavior ', ' cloud based ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' learning algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2020,1134000,PA-03,0.05127069007503159
"New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns PROJECT SUMMARY Summary The Brimrose Technology Corporation and Johns Hopkins University are forming a powerful new team to make a new instrument that has the potential to dramatically reduce a major global health problem–perinatal hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)–by enabling early detection during labor. HIE caused by asphyxia is a leading cause of infant fatalities as well as a source of cerebral palsy and other long-term severe neurologic impairments. The medical community has been limited in early diagnosis of HIE because current fetal heart rate monitoring has poor specificity. If identified early, HIE can be treated effectively with therapeutic hypothermia. We are proposing a fetal photoacoustic monitoring system that measures oxyhemoglobin saturation of the sagittal sinus vein draining the fetal cerebral cortex during labor. Sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases to very low levels when placental gas exchange is impaired (hypoxia) and/or when fetal cerebral perfusion pressure falls (ischemia). The photoacoustic instrument transmits light through the open fontanelle or bone and into cerebral veins and tissue where ultrasound waves are generated. Using near- infrared incident light at discrete wavelengths that are absorbed preferentially by oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, ultrasound detected on the fetal scalp at each wavelength can estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation. Brimrose has constructed a novel ultrasound detection technology with sensitivity orders of magnitude greater than the current best-use piezo-electric sensors. This will permit the use of low-power LED light sources rather than cumbersome laser lights now employed, thereby avoiding safety goggle use and promoting greater deployment. The Hopkins team has already validated the ability of a standard photoacoustic system to accurately estimate sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation through the skull of newborn piglets. The purpose of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of using safe, low power LED light sources with the new ultrasensitive ultrasound sensor to detect critically low sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation when oxygenation is manipulated. The platform will be based on in-silico simulation to optimize the acoustic and optical pathways for the skull and brain. Real-time measurements on a time scale of seconds will inform the obstetric caregiver of dynamic fluctuations of brain oxygenation during contractions. The Phase II goal is to make a miniaturized photoacoustic device prototype that can report on fetal brain oxygenation. We believe the resulting instrument will provide early detection brain HI with greater specificity and sensitivity, enabling early intervention and treatment and is potentially transferrable to a commercial model for manufacture. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Brimrose Technology Corporation and the Johns Hopkins University propose making a new instrument to potentially dramatically reduce the incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can result in mortality or lifelong disabilities. Our goal is to develop an intrapartum fetal brain monitor using photoacoustics with inexpensive, safe and clinically convenient light emitting diodes (LEDs) to noninvasively and instantaneously identify the fetus at risk for brain injury. Phase I is intended to provide a proof-of-concept using low power LED light sources and a novel ultrasensitive ultrasound detector rather than standard laser light sources and piezo-electric detectors.",New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns,10010328,R43HD102260,"['absorption ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aluminum ', ' Al element ', ' Animals ', ' Asphyxia ', ' Suffocation ', ' asphyxiation ', ' Auscultation ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' bone ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' cerebral vein ', ' Cesarean section ', ' Abdominal Delivery ', ' C section ', ' Cesarean ', ' Communities ', ' Electricity ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Fetal Monitoring ', ' fetus monitoring ', ' Fetus ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' Fetal Heart Rate ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hybrids ', ' natural hypothermia ', ' Hypothermia ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Ischemia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neodymium ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxyhemoglobin ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution ', ' Tissue Distribution ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Universities ', ' Veins ', ' Yttrium ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Metabolic acidosis ', ' Fontanelle ', ' Structure of fontanel of skull ', ' disability ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxia ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Supersonic waves ', ' Ultrasound waves ', ' Ultrasonic wave ', ' instrument ', ' Venous ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Cerebral perfusion pressure ', ' Sagittal Sinus ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' at-risk fetus ', ' fetus at risk ', ' intrapartum ', ' Perinatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy ', ' Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury ', ' Live Birth ', ' fetal ', ' chromophore ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' light scattering ', ' hazard ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' global health ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' energy density ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ', ' neonatal HIE ', ' neonatal hypoxia-ischemia ', ' neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury ', ' Neonatal ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' optoacoustic imaging ', ' photoacoustic imaging ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' heart rate monitor ', ' neonatal brain ', ' brain oxygenation ', ' cerebral oxygenation ', ' fetal brain injury ', ' Maternal-fetal medicine ', ' microphone ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIMROSE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION,R43,2020,149978,MD-07,0.020039824730560676
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions.

"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10029386,R01MH123482,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' analog ', ' Exposure to ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' heart rate variability ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' phenomenology ', ' phenomenological models ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' biomarker-driven ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' deep learning ', ' microphone ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,570435,NH-02,0.029273048162467123
"Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates Summary/Abstract Each year, about 5-18% of babies are born preterm, accounting for over 0.5M births in the US and 15M globally. Many of these babies are admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) where the medical staff generally have the option of using either invasive arterial lines (IALs) or inflatable-cuff non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. The former introduces the risk of infection, tissue and nerve damage, and the latter is less accurate, especially for hypotensive infants, and may add the risk of ischemic and nerve damage upon repeated measurement. There is a clear need for a safer, continuous, and cost effective form of NIBP measurement to meet the challenge of managing unhealthy blood pressures for neonates. PyrAmes Inc. has developed a novel capacitive sensor technology that is paper thin and flexible and can accurately detect blood pressure (BP). This sensor technology is part of a unique continuous BP monitoring platform that provides accurate, lightweight and comfortable BP monitoring in a wireless, wrist-worn package that is easy to use. The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to apply non-invasively and records pulsatile data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties of placing and maintaining an arterial line. This device can provide gold standard BP monitoring without perturbing the patients for more accurate and relevant measurements. The objective of this project is to extend the platform for use with term and pre-term neonates. This goal will be accomplished through redesign of the sensor hardware and optimization of the data analytics software. We will validate these modifications with clinical data from the NICU at Stanford University Medical Center. In Phase I, we will miniaturize the electronics and modify the sensor array of a wrist-worn pulse wave monitor to be sized more appropriately for neonates. We will validate the new device design by collecting NICU clinical data from patients who have IALs in place in an IRB-approved study. From IAL and sensor data taken simultaneously, we will determine ground truth values on a pulse-by-pulse basis and use these data in conjunction with additional IAL data from historical databases to improve our sensor quality and predictive BP models. Our success metric will be to equal or exceed the quality and accuracy of our data for adults. Phase II will be a follow-up IRB-approved pivotal study using the device from Phase 1 to position our device for FDA submission and clearance and scale up to pilot production of this device. Project Narrative The goal of this Phase 1 project is to confirm that machine learning can be used to extract blood pressure values for critically ill neonates from pulse waveform data collected with a wearable, non-invasive device that is comfortable, low-cost and easy to use. The proposed device will significantly reduce the need for frequent cuff-based measurements and/or invasive arterial lines, thereby decreasing morbidity, risk of complications, patient discomfort, and overall cost of care. This project is based on the pioneering efforts of Prof. Zhenan Bao’s lab at Stanford on thin film sensors for electronic skin and includes the design and use of a miniaturized device to collect clinical data from neonates that will be used to validate a model which derives blood pressure values from the pulse waveform without external calibration.",Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates,9910153,R43HD101175,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arterial Lines ', ' Intra-Arterial Lines ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood pressure determination ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Calibration ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Electromagnetics ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Infant ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Medical Staff ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nerve ', ' Noise ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Polychlorinated Biphenyls ', ' PCBs ', ' Polychlorobiphenyl Compounds ', ' polychlorobiphenyl ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tonometry ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Device Designs ', ' Film ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' System ', ' Coin ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' miniaturize ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' Skin ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neonate ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' Neonatal ', ' cost effective ', ' Consumption ', ' encryption ', ' demographics ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Data Analytics ', ' premature neonates ', ' premature newborn ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm newborn ', ' Bluetooth ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' care costs ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' neural network ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NICHD,"PYRAMES, INC.",R43,2020,224556,CA-17,0.11691334331138999
"Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions Project Summary  The goal of this project is to further develop an existing smart stethoscope in order to be capable of monitoring pediatric patients at home who suffer from asthma as well as adults with COPD. Lung diseases impose a serious burden on healthcare systems, individuals and governments. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) ranked third and fourth as the leading causes of death in 2016, each claiming 3 million lives annually. LRIs accounted for 14.9% of pediatric deaths, making it the leading cause of infant mortality after pre-term birth. Asthma—a condition for which, like COPD, there is no cure—is also the leading chronic disease in children and an estimated 235 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, with over 380,000 deaths from the disease in 2015. Asthma and COPD costed the United States approximately $56 billion and $72 billion last year, respectively. The burden of these diseases and the health disparities across populations is only slated to get worse in the coming decade, as respiratory diseases are expected to increase by 155% due to an aging population and increased pollution, while there is expected to a large shortage of pulmonary specialists, with an expect 7% decline by 2030.  We reasoned that a long-term monitoring solution that can be used in the home by untrained patients, or family members of patients, that could detect and monitor severity of airway inflammation in patients, provide insight into reasons for worsening or improved symptoms, push tailored educational content, and direct patients to medical follow before the situation becomes acute, would empower patients with chronic conditions while also reducing trips to emergency departments and readmission rates to hospitals. We find that several challenges exist when considering long term auscultatory monitoring solutions in non-traditional clinical settings: (1) unpredictable ambient noise, (2) the need for medical expertise to interpret lung sounds, (3) subjectivity in the analysis, and (4) difficulty using and placing the stethoscope. The research team developed a smart stethoscope that was originally intended for use in low-resource countries by community health workers to differentiate between pediatric patients with crackles and wheezes that overcomes many of these challenges. This smart stethoscope address all the challenges above by including (1) adaptive noise suppression that has been objectively and subjectively proven to be superior in all types of noise environments than traditional or other electronic stethoscopes, (2) on-board analysis algorithms that can detect crackles and wheezes in pediatric patients with an accuracy that matches that of a specialist, and (3) a uniform pickup surface that removes the requirement for exact placement of the device to get an accurate recording. In this project, we will validate that the device can be correctly used by parents of children with asthma and accurate recordings can be taken that are similar in quality to those that would be taken by a medical professional. Simultaneously, we will be using patient feedback to iterate on the device and mobile app design to create a version that patients are comfortable using in their home. Once the device and app have been validated in Phase I, we plan to move into directly into Phase II where the device will enter in a second phase of investigation that will include a first-time longitudinal study from parents of pediatric patients taking daily recordings in their home. This data will then be used for the development of algorithms to determine lung sound severities with metrics that can be tracked and predicted over time. In parallel to the this clinical study and algorithm development, recordings will be taken of adult patients with COPD to expand the usability of the device beyond pediatrics. Project Narrative This proposal aims to validate a smart auscultation device for home use and develop algorithms that can track changes in, and severity of, lung sounds in order to monitor patients over long periods of time, improve the clinical relevance of home monitoring for timely interventions, and decrease hospital admissions. Current state of the art technology available to patients suffering from asthma and COPD is unable to intelligently monitor patients at home and no long-term monitoring solutions exist for these conditions, resulting in increases in emergency department visits. The academic partner has developed a smart stethoscope that offers greatly improved audio fidelity in any type of noise environment, automated on-board analysis and detection algorithms of lung sounds, and increased ease of use. The small business partner is in the process of commercializing the device for clinical use by trained, professional personnel. Together, we are aiming to test whether the device can be reliably used by non-trained personnel for home use, develop algorithms that would provide metrics for monitoring trends and severities of lung sounds and predict future severity, expand the current abilities of the stethoscope from pediatrics to all patients, and transfer this technology to the small business partner for further clinical testing and commercial development such that it can improve the long-term outcome for patients with chronic lung conditions.",Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope

"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal

"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials.

"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Shoulder ', ' Skin Temperature ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sports Medicine ', ' Swelling ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Temperature ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Articular Range of Motion ', ' Joint Range of Motion ', ' range of motion ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Businesses ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' Supraspinatus ', ' supraspinatus muscle ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' miniaturize ', ' fall risk ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' trial comparing ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' rotator cuff tear ', ' improved outcome ', ' physiotherapist ', ' physical therapist ', ' post-operative rehab ', ' postoperative rehab ', ' postoperative rehabilitation ', ' post-operative rehabilitation ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wireless communication ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,CA-49,0.07152526505340755
"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' bone ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Charge ', ' Communication ', ' Elements ', ' Energy Transfer ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heating ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Power Sources ', ' Power Supplies ', ' pressure ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Caring ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' sonar ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Supersonic waves ', ' Ultrasound waves ', ' Ultrasonic wave ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' subcutaneous ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Skin ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Artificial Heart Ventricle ', ' Artificial Ventricles ', ' Ventricle-Assist Device ', ' ventricular assist device ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Data ', ' pre-clinical testing ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Implant ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' patient population ', ' in vitro testing ', ' product development ', ' clinical practice ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' verification and validation ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' operation ', ' Geometry ', ' radiofrequency ', ' radio frequency ', ' LVAD ', ' left ventricular assist device ', ' Bluetooth ', ' wireless communication ', ' ']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,MA-04,0.00909246911328823

"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[''],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,IL-09,-0.00548625756688526
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10140938,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Display ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', "" Patients' Rooms "", ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Ventilator ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Instruction ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' interoperability ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' encryption ', ' clinical care ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' Secure ', ' application program interface ', ' application programming interface ', ' data access ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' FHIR ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2020,210642,MA-05,0.07580877779910465
"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician.

"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10034533,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Budgets ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Manufactured form ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' conditioning ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' nano fabricate ', ' nano fabrication ', ' nanofabricate ', ' nanofabrication ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' neurotechnology ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' safety testing ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' signal processing ', ' trigonometric ', ' trigonometry ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' first in man ', ' first-in-human ', ' animal safety ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,885873,MN-05,-0.02342012250163655
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9901577,R01MH111916,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Breeding ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' vocalization ', ' gaze ', ' limb movement ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' offspring ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' vocal learning ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Scheme ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' social communication ', ' human disease ', ' speech processing ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' optogenetics ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' microphone ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' automated analysis ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' motion sensor ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data streams ', ' machine learning method ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,521954,MA-07,0.024981506771979325
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device Safety ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Device Designs ', ' Device Safety ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' systems research ', ' post-market ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' surveillance study ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Injections ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,TN-05,0.08034165005579771
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration ', ' Beds ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' treatment group ', ' Data Analytics ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' lower income families ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' circadian ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,NY-13,0.0882315366460838
"Dense Life-log Health Analytics from Wearable Sensors using Functional Analysis and Riemannian Geometry Project Summary The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled lifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' data base structure ', ' database structure ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' learning algorithm ', ' Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' ']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,TX-17,0.004581682172521589
"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Animals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Contact Dermatitis ', ' Contact Eczema ', ' Dermatitis Venenata ', ' Economics ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymphatic nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' lymphnodes ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', "" Workers' Compensation "", ' Workmans Compensation ', "" Workmen's Compensation "", ' Workmens Compensation ', ' Generations ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Cavia ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' Allergic Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Allergic Contact Dermatitis ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' occupational hazard ', ' Knowledge ', ' Reaction ', ' Test Result ', ' Occupational ', ' Prostheses and Implants ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' skin patch ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Advanced Development ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevalence ', ' chemical release ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ICCVAM ', ' Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' operation ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' systemic toxicity ', ' software as a service ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' web server ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' in silico ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' knowledge graph ', ' ']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,NC-04,0.04375851711852055
"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Charge ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Privacy ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Visual ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Notification ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' monitoring device ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' Devices ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' Bluetooth ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' medication non-adherence ', ' medication nonadherence ', ' privacy preservation ', ' data privacy ', ' ']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,IL-07,0.09022290082537467
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach.

"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space. The implications of this work are broad including diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitoring tools, and research tools to enable longitudinal isolation of disease-inducing cells or non-invasive protein measurements from a single host without euthanasia.",Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring,10054726,K99EB028840,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Award ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ', ' EAE ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalitis ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis ', ' autoimmune encephalomyelitis ', ' Engineering ', ' Euthanasia ', ' Mercy Killing ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Foreign Bodies ', ' Future ', ' Gel ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Morbidity -

"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",10024064,R44ES028656,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Digestion ', ' Disinfection ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' lead poisonings ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' lead toxicity ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' Michigan ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Specialist ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Particulate ', ' meter ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' water quality ', ' hazard ', ' drinking water ', ' aqueous ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' rapid detection ', ' Pb concentration ', ' lead concentration ', ' Pb contaminated ', ' Pb contamination ', ' Pb2+ contaminated ', ' Pb2+ contamination ', ' contaminated to lead ', ' contamination to lead ', ' lead contaminated ', ' lead contamination ', ' nano sensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' nanosensors ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Data Analytics ', ' graphene ', ' service providers ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' well water ', ' ']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2020,719088,WI-04,0.043299774255952994
