"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein and protein- RNA interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high-throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.              Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9229841,F99CA212457,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Diaries ', ' Dietary Records ', ' Diet Records ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fluouracil ', ' Fluoruracil ', ' Fluoro Uracil ', ' 5FU ', ' 5-Fluracil ', ' 5-FU ', ' Fluorouracil ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Aminoacetic Acid ', ' Glycine ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methionine ', ' Metotrexato ', ' Methotrexatum ', ' Methotrexate Methylaminopterin ', ' Methotrexate ', ' Patients ', ' L-Serine ', ' Serine ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Multitargeted Antifolate ', ' Pemetrexed ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Metabolic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Cellular Regulation ', ' cell growth regulation ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' DNA Methylation Regulation ', ' Dietary Component ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' Cancerous ', ' experimental analysis ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' tumor metabolism ', ' tumor cell metabolism ', ' cancer metabolism ', ' cancer cell metabolism ', ' precision medicine ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' genomic profiles ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F99,2016,32196,NY-23,0.027195101214322698

"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health.

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group. The development of this computer science technology is the first step toward automating the eCoaching process.",Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier

"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Attention ', ' automated data processing ', ' Electronic Data Processing ', ' Computer Data Processing ', ' Automatic Data Processing ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dissociation ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Visual ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' ionization ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Oranges ', ' protein expression ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' chemical standard ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' database query ', ' data base query ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,MA-07,0.14536635749723437
"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers).

"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Algorithms ', ' α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Patients ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Serum Proteins ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' protein metabolite ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' model building ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' survival outcome ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,TX-14,0.03882772662919194
"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.    PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing. As an extension of our prior work, we will build and test computational models and datasets for individual P450 isozymes that accurately predict drug metabolites and the rate (kinetics) at which they form. We will then combine these models for an effective, low cost approach that simulates hepatic P450 metabolism and takes into account age-dependent contributions from individual isozymes to assess the metabolic fate of drugs during child development.  ",Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate,9215358,R01LM012482,"['absorption ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Chemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' P450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' d-Methorphan ', ' DXM ', ' Dextromethorphan ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' Isozymes ', ' Isoenzymes ', ' Kinetics ', ' Literature ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Microsomes ', ' Midazolam ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Fenitoin ', ' Diphenylhydantoin ', ' Dilantin ', ' Phenytoin ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Hepatic ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' drug metabolism ', ' drug clearance ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' repository ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' drug structure ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Recombinants ', ' Enzyme Kinetics ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' Formulation ', ' ']",NLM,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2016,323537,AR-02,0.11543697687871796

"Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kynurenine catabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation in humans produces metabolites that are neurologically active and affect neurotransmission and neuronal integrity. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a product of the pathway which has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and has been correlated with depression in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-α. Besides, activation of the kynurenine pathway by inflammation leads to elevated levels of QUIN, which have been shown to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. The mechanism by which QUIN acts in the brain is to activate excitotoxic neurotransmitter pathways involving the amino acid glutamate and by leading to lipid peroxidation. Following metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent steps, three consecutive enzymes of the kynurenine pathway determine the metabolic partitioning of tryptophan metabolites to QUIN, picolinic acid (PIC), or further metabolism. We hypothesize that the shift of QUIN and PIC levels is linked to chronic inflammation and major depression. To test this hypothesis, we will, in the first aim, study the structure and action of the enzymes and the mechanisms controlling QUIN and PIC production. In the second aim, a new, rapid and efficient analytical method will be developed for in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of QUIN and PIC levels and will be applied to samples obtained from patient populations expected to exhibit high levels of QUIN as a result of increased inflammation and from assays using purified protein to simulate similar distributions. Through these studies, the correlation between kynurenine metabolites and major depression will be investigated, and small molecule inhibitors will be used as probes for modulating the production of QUIN and PIC levels.         ",Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study,9112097,R21MH107985,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' HIV-related dementia ', ' HIV-Associated Cognitive

"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients.         PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites.

"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health.

"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9265938,R01LM012222,"['Algorithms ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Rash ', ' Exanthem ', ' Exanthema ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ', ' Erythema Multiforme Major ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Withdrawal ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Metabolic ', ' gene function ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Adverse reactions ', ' adduct ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' immunogenic ', ' repository ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' liver metabolism ', ' hepatic metabolism ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' immunogenicity ', ' quantum ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' drug candidate ', ' screening ', ' model building ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' online repository ', ' web-based repository ', ' web repository ', ' online archive ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' clinical development ', ' ']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,374026,MO-01,0.14276391701397198
"Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kynurenine catabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation in humans produces metabolites that are neurologically active and affect neurotransmission and neuronal integrity. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a product of the pathway which has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and has been correlated with depression in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-α. Besides, activation of the kynurenine pathway by inflammation leads to elevated levels of QUIN, which have been shown to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. The mechanism by which QUIN acts in the brain is to activate excitotoxic neurotransmitter pathways involving the amino acid glutamate and by leading to lipid peroxidation. Following metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent steps, three consecutive enzymes of the kynurenine pathway determine the metabolic partitioning of tryptophan metabolites to QUIN, picolinic acid (PIC), or further metabolism. We hypothesize that the shift of QUIN and PIC levels is linked to chronic inflammation and major depression. To test this hypothesis, we will, in the first aim, study the structure and action of the enzymes and the mechanisms controlling QUIN and PIC production. In the second aim, a new, rapid and efficient analytical method will be developed for in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of QUIN and PIC levels and will be applied to samples obtained from patient populations expected to exhibit high levels of QUIN as a result of increased inflammation and from assays using purified protein to simulate similar distributions. Through these studies, the correlation between kynurenine metabolites and major depression will be investigated, and small molecule inhibitors will be used as probes for modulating the production of QUIN and PIC levels.

"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers).

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group. The development of this computer science technology is the first step toward automating the eCoaching process.",Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9250169,R01GM114029,"['Adoption ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Language ', ' Linear Models ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Phenotype ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Galaxy ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' rapid growth ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Plug-in ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,339051,WA-07,0.14638473458432835
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9347295,R44HL127843,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Pheresis ', ' Hemapheresis ', ' Apheresis ', ' Blood Component Removal ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Europe ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glutathione ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' State Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Production ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Plts ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' TRNSF ', ' Transfusion ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' wasting ', ' Recovery ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model design ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Length ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' Supplementation ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' oxidative damage ', ' Formulation ', ' open innovation ', ' metabolic profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,1099022,CA-49,0.03799032355882687
"Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics Project Summary  Metabolites are building blocks of cellular function, thus understanding the mechanisms that underlie various physiological conditions and processes will provide insight into disease or aberrant states. Innovative developments in high-throughput analytical technologies and data analysis have allowed for systems-level metabolomics analyses to be performed, many of these technologies have centered around mass spectrometry. The diverse chemical structures in the human metabolome exhibit a wide range of concentration, solubility, polarity and volatility with highly diverse structural forms and physiochemical properties as well as a high number of isomers, therefore the need for as many orthogonal separations as possible is necessary for metabolomics experiments (i.e., multidimensional data sets). Mass spectrometry approaches incorporating liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS) analyses have shown utility for global untargeted metabolic profiling experiments. Since ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a relatively new commercially available technology, the incorporation of the ion mobility measurement (via collision cross section, CCS) into current metabolomics data analysis identification strategies is minimal. The typical analytical use of ion mobility is as a quick chemical separation (which allows for noise reduction, increase in peak capacity, etc.), however IM can also be used to increase the confidence in identification and characterization because CCS provides structure specific information about individual metabolites. The long term objectives of this proposal are all centered around incorporating IM measurements into metabolomics based chemoinformatic and bioinformatics pipelines. These include: (1) determining the extent at which the ion mobility dimension can address molecular specificity of isomeric metabolites, (2) developing an IM-based library using CCS values as a descriptor to screen and assign identities to unknown metabolites and lastly, (3) incorporating visualization tools for navigating multidimensional datasets which will allow scientists to better uncover relationships between metabolites and human health. Molecular specificity of the IM dimension will be addressed by analyzing previously generated IM-MS data from a commercially available metabolite library (>600 primary metabolites, of which >20% are isomeric). Individual metabolites in the metabolite library will also be interrogated for curation of the CCS library and these values will be used in the molecular identification pipeline for global untargeted metabolite studies generated previously. Lastly, multidimensional self-organizing maps will be utilized to visualize and navigate various dimensions of data (LC, CCS, m/z, etc.) and ultimately allow the user to prioritize and identify with high confidence metabolites indicative of disease state. Accomplishing the aims outlined in this proposal will be seen as overcoming several critical barriers which have so far hindered the routine and widespread use of ion mobility in MS-based metabolomics workflows. Project Narrative  The innovative developments described in the proposal incorporate high-throughput metabolomics technologies, big data informatics, and multidimensional visualization strategies which will allow scientists to uncover relationships between metabolites and human health using systems-level metabolomics analyses. Specifically, we believe these goals can be accomplished by overcoming several critical barriers to adopting new technologies based on multidimensional mass spectrometry which hold promise for furthering our knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems. Strategies outlined in this proposal include, providing a highly annotated library incorporating empirical ion mobility based collision cross section values (inclusive also of exact mass, fragment ion data, and retention time) and developing novel big data and visualization strategies to improve throughput and confidence in metabolite annotations.",Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics,9433378,R03CA222452,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chemistry ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ions ', ' Isomerism ', ' isomer ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Noise ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phonation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Solubility ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' professor ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Property ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' chemical informatics ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' ion mobility ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' data visualization ', ' metabolic profile ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,151533,TN-05,0.10846411211848171
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions.

"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9260548,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Societies ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' small molecule ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' experimental analysis ', ' stem ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' biological systems ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,356625,TX-09,0.10114867082003767
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9479284,R01LM012222,"['Algorithms ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Exanthema ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Rash ', ' Exanthem ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ', ' Erythema Multiforme Major ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Withdrawal ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Metabolic ', ' gene function ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Adverse reactions ', ' adduct ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' immunogenic ', ' repository ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' liver metabolism ', ' hepatic metabolism ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' immunogenicity ', ' quantum ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' drug candidate ', ' screening ', ' model building ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' web-based repository ', ' web repository ', ' online archive ', ' online repository ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' clinical development ', ' ']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,374026,MO-01,0.14276391701397198
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope.

"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.   PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing.

"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer.

"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9506810,R44HL127843,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Component Removal ', ' Pheresis ', ' Hemapheresis ', ' Apheresis ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Europe ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' State Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Plts ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' TRNSF ', ' Transfusion ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' wasting ', ' Recovery ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model design ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Length ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' pre-clinical testing ', ' Supplementation ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' oxidative damage ', ' Formulation ', ' open innovation ', ' metabolic profile ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' care costs ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,428727,CA-49,0.03799032355882687
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9576319,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' male ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9589711,U01CA235508,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Letters ', ' stable isotope ', ' Metabolic ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Stable Isotope Labeling ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' file format ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' comparative ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,439996,TN-05,0.12144012631187386
"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9470426,R01CA218664,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', '

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning.

In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9545787,R01GM089753,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Supervision ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Lasso ', ' Homologous Sequences ', ' Sequence Homologs ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' monomer ', ' protein structure function ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein complex ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Homologue ', ' Homolog ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Protein Family ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' atomic interactions ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2018,306425,IL-01,0.054614091691422804
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools.

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9786702,U01CA235508,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Measurement ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' Letters ', ' stable isotope ', ' Metabolic ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Stable Isotope Labeling ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' file format ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' comparative ', ' biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,431816,TN-05,0.12144012631187386
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,9818197,R01LM012974,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Semantics ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Health Campaign ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' Health behavior change ', ' network models ', ' Regimen ', ' online community ', ' virtual community ', ' on-line community ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' social media ', ' Discourse analysis ', ' Conversation analysis ', ' Self-Direction ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2019,372890,TX-09,0.026433295765728934
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9742516,R01LM012222,"['necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Rash ', ' Exanthem ', ' Exanthema ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Literature ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Erythema Multiforme Major ', ' Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Metabolic ', ' gene function ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Adverse reactions ', ' adduct ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' immunogenic ', ' repository ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' liver metabolism ', ' hepatic metabolism ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' immunogenicity ', ' quantum ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' drug candidate ', ' screening ', ' model building ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' online repository ', ' web-based repository ', ' web repository ', ' online archive ', ' on-line repository ', ' on-line archive ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' clinical development ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' ']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,374026,MO-01,0.14276391701397198
"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9621372,K00CA212457,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carbon ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Diaries ', ' Dietary Records ', ' Diet Records ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fluouracil ', ' Fluoruracil ', ' Fluoro Uracil ', ' 5FU ', ' 5-Fluracil ', ' 5-FU ', ' Fluorouracil ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Aminoacetic Acid ', ' Glycine ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methionine ', ' Metotrexato ', ' Methotrexatum ', ' Methotrexate Methylaminopterin ', ' Methotrexate ', ' Patients ', ' L-Serine ', ' Serine ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Pemetrexed ', ' Multitargeted Antifolate ', ' Anabolism ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Metabolic ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' cell growth regulation ', ' Cellular Regulation ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' DNA Methylation Regulation ', ' Dietary Component ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' Cancerous ', ' experimental analysis ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' genomic profiles ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' interindividual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' genomic predictors ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' patient response ', ' responsive patient ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2019,83070,CA-18,0.027195101214322698
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements.

"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9789208,R01CA218664,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', '

"Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate   ABSTRACT Advancements in pediatric drug development require innovative approaches that overcome challenges in assessing age-dependent drug disposition and toxic risks related to metabolism. Cytochromes P450 dominate drug metabolism yet roles for individual enzymes depend on genetics, disease states, co-medications, and ontogeny. Failure to account for those differences contributes to dosing challenges and possibly toxicity as reported for dextromethorphan, midazolam, and phenytoin. The NICHD Pediatric Formulation Initiative (PFI) workshops emphasized the need for better modeling to describe and predict how drug metabolism changes for children. Current pharmacokinetic models predict how drug clearance changes with age that affect the optimal dose, but those models are limited in two ways; (1) they require experimentally determined kinetic data for several enzymes that is not often available, and (2) they do not model formation of specific drug metabolites, which is important in predicting toxicity and drug interactions, regardless of whether clearance changes with age. We hypothesize that computational models of mixtures of P450 enzymes can predict how the “metabolic fate”, i.e. the kinetics of drug metabolism and the resulting metabolite structures, of drugs changes with age. We propose building hierarchical mathematical models that at first predict the drug metabolites formed by metabolic enzymes (Aim 1), then the efficiency of formation for each metabolite (the kinetics) (Aim 2), and combine these models to predict metabolites formed by age-specific mixtures of P450s (Aim 3). This proposal makes significant steps toward achieving PFI goals. First, datasets created for this study will be made publicly available to foster model refinement and validation by the community. Second, simulation of metabolite profiles would yield tractable biomarkers and support studies on possible age-dependent drug-drug interactions, off- target biological activities, pro-drug activation, and formation of toxic species. Third, the models will indicate, for both new and existing drugs, when metabolic fate (consequently, toxicity and interactions) changes in pediatric patients, even when pharmacokinetics stay the same. Fourth, though not the primary aim of this study, successfully modeling metabolic efficiency could enable pharmacokinetic studies for predicting problematic pediatric drugs prior to carrying out any necessary experimental kinetic studies. Taken together, this proposal lays a strong foundation for developing models relevant that resolve challenges in optimizing drug dosages and minimizing toxicity risks for children.   PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of age on cytochrome P450 metabolism makes drug disposition and toxic risks moving targets for pediatric patients, such that robust strategies to identify and assess ontogenetic (age-dependent) effects on drug metabolic fate (in vitro kinetics and metabolite structures) are clearly needed to better personalize drug development for pediatric dosing. As an extension of our prior work, we will build and test computational models and datasets for individual P450 isozymes that accurately predict drug metabolites and the rate (kinetics) at which they form. We will then combine these models for an effective, low cost approach that simulates hepatic P450 metabolism and takes into account age-dependent contributions from individual isozymes to assess the metabolic fate of drugs during child development.  ",Computationally modeling the impact of ontogeny on drug metabolic fate,9762980,R01LM012482,"['absorption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' P450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' d-Methorphan ', ' DXM ', ' Dextromethorphan ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' In Vitro ', ' Isozymes ', ' Isoenzymes ', ' Kinetics ', ' Literature ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Microsomes ', ' Midazolam ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Fenitoin ', ' Diphenylhydantoin ', ' Dilantin ', ' Phenytoin ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Hepatic ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Failure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' Pharmacology and Toxicology ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' drug clearance ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' repository ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Access to Information ', ' outreach to information ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Recombinants ', ' Enzyme Kinetics ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' Formulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' drug disposition ', ' pediatric drug development ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' ']",NLM,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2019,313125,AR-02,0.11543697687871796
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9750581,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients.

"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers).

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and

"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our techniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset,10111982,R03OD030601,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatography ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Histidine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Maps ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Societies ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Catalogs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' protein expression ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' cost ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' biological systems ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' annotation  system ', ' neural network ', ' ']",OD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2020,263120,MA-07,0.06320949134500825
"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure relationship and to predict protein structures.

The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,10002192,U01CA235508,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Letters ', ' stable isotope ', ' Metabolic ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Stable Isotope Labeling ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' file format ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' comparative ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data standardization ', ' data standards ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,427122,TN-05,0.12144012631187386
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Anaerobic Bacteria ', ' anaerobe ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Genes ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Tyrosine ', ' Uremia ', ' uremia of renal origin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' diet alteration ', ' dietary alteration ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' tricresol ', ' Cresol ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Sulfate ', ' Ablation ', ' human data ', ' mutant ', ' solute ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' Individual Differences ', ' community microbes ', ' microbial community ', ' Microbe ', ' reconstitute ', ' reconstitution ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' gut microbiota ', ' comparative genomics ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microbiota ', ' translation to humans ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' colon microbes ', ' colon microbial community ', ' colonic microbiota ', ' colon microbiota ', ' microbiota derived metabolites ', ' microbiota metabolites ', ' Infrastructure ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,CA-18,0.055420451602578705
"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors. We propose to study how a novel tumor suppressor peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome that we identified directly regulates the nuclear genome to coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation.",Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors,9944175,R01GM136837,"['Adenosine Monophosphate ', "" 5'-Adenylic acid "", ' Adenylic Acid ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electron Transport ', ' electron transfer ', ' Endothelium ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' In Vitro ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Language ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Organelles ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' TP53 gene ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation Project Summary/Abstract Cancer metabolism is a complex network of perturbations to essential chemical and enzymatic reactions; however, the past century has seen a largely reductionist approach to understanding this system. While previously this approach was necessary due to technological limitations, current computer age technological advances allow us to survey, model, and explore the biological details of individual cells and populations of cells. Scientific fields, such as RNA biology and metabolism, have experienced massive strides in recent decades with the advent of RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, yet our ability to contextualize and extract the full extent of these enormous datasets continues to lag and often results in focusing on only a handful of entities from a dataset. This effectively causes “big data” to become “little data”. This is problematic as these experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to produce, yet we only use a fraction of the total data produced by a given experiment. For the F99 phase of my proposal, I will address these limitations by leading the development of Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational analysis framework built upon our previous work to contextualize -omics datasets within customizable and global metabolic network representations. This framework will lay the foundation allowing for the exploration of complex forms of metabolic regulation in cancer. For example, we will analyze the ability of metabolic networks to undergo dispersed and low-magnitude regulation, where, rather than one or two components acting as the core regulatory actors, regulation is performed by dispersed groups of genes, proteins, or metabolites. This framework and related regulatory research will revolutionize our ability to more holistically understand temporal metabolic shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum amount of information from our data. For the K00 phase of my proposal, I will work with a postdoctoral mentor at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or affiliated institution that will supplement my training in machine learning and network biology to develop models that improve our ability to predict metabolic state from transcriptomic state. Doing so will allow us to harness the vast transcriptomics databases in cancer biology to better understand the role of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations. My ultimate goal is to become a tenured professor and run an independent, NIH-funded research lab that focuses on computational cancer metabolism research and that develops methods for interrogating this emerging domain of biology. Project Narrative While cancer metabolism is a robust and well-developed research field, approaches to its holistic understanding are still under-developed and hinder our ability to contextualize these complex metabolic states and their consequences. During the F99 phase, I will develop tools and methods that allow researchers to explore data in a more holistic manner than previously possible, which will be essential to elucidating more complicated regulatory mechanisms within cancer metabolism. During the K00 phase, I will develop novel machine learning algorithms that will improve our ability to predict the metabolic state from the transcriptional state, allowing us to harness the rich transcription datasets found in cancer biology for therapeutic benefit.",Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation,10065368,F99CA253744,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computers ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' chemical reaction ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Post-Transcriptional Control ', ' post-transcriptional gene regulation ', ' posttranscriptional control ', ' posttranscriptional regulation ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Predictive Cancer Model ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' neglect ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' cancer cell metabolism ', ' cancer metabolism ', ' tumor cell metabolism ', ' tumor metabolism ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning network ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F99,2020,36742,UT-02,0.0347320980172554
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,9979950,R01LM012974,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Health Campaign ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' Health behavior change ', ' network models ', ' Regimen ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' social media ', ' Conversation analysis ', ' Discourse analysis ', ' Self-Direction ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' social relationships ', ' virtual coach ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,342713,TX-09,0.026433295765728934
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD.

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9985087,R01CA218664,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', '

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9899255,R01GM114029,"['Adoption ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Language ', ' Linear Models ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Phenotype ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Galaxy ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' rapid growth ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Plug-in ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Visualization ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,336869,WA-07,0.14638473458432835
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9906155,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' male ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods.

"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases.

The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Research ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' magnetic field ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' Imaging problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' 1H- Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging ', ' MRSI ', ' Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging ', ' magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' quantum ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Coupling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' patient population ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' clinical translation ', ' imaging study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,IL-13,0.07060351692132115
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,9995722,R01GM131491,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gases ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical effect ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,395738,WA-07,0.12453560160540626
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.
