"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7809627,K08DE016956,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Defect ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' surveillance study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Molecular ', ' Affect ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cleft lip with or without cleft palate ', ' cl/p ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cleft Lip ', ' hare lip ', ' Harelip ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' oral cleft ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2010,129456,MA-07,0.06981861713579252
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,8008651,R01LM009012,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Age ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Algorithms ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' New Hampshire ', ' Genetic ', ' Research ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Complex ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Measures ', ' Modeling ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' cancer type ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' ']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2010,392680,NH-02,0.021110465267504392
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.            The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. This technology will be employed to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  Studies here will focus on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from a collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. The hypothesis to be tested is that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood.  Two potential modifiers will be examined: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress will be tested by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the ETC. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, once can begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.              Public Health Relevance/",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8218308,R01ES020819,"['Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Fumarates ', ' pollutant ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' Vitamin A ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' Body Fluids ', ' toxicant ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human population study ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' Harvest ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Dose ', ' base ', ' Lipids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' in vivo ', ' Staging ', ' Technology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Genetic ', ' Population ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Succinates ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Work ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' extracellular ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Metabolic ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' high risk ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Genomics ', ' Resolution ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' response ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Defect ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Exhibits ', ' Physiology ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Data ', ' Length ', ' Complex ', ' Collaborations ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' novel ', ' Affect ', ' Time ', ' Clinical ', ' Toxicology ', ' Environment ', ' insight ', ' Distal ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' public health relevance ', ' Population Study ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Organelles ', ' TimeLine ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Charge ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' statistics ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' organic acid ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' Modeling ', ' Testing ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Investigation ', ' Generations ', ' Publishing ', ' Methods ', ' Biochemical ', ' Reporting ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2011,395592,WA-07,-0.009142571526455416
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease. We propose to study the complex interplay of environmental, immunological and genetic factors to discover molecular signatures with a potential to advance clinical diagnosis and therapy at or before the onset of T1D.           The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals¿ cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.              Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.        Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,8324692,R01LM009012,"['Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' New Hampshire ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cancer type ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' combinatorial ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,369433,NH-02,0.021110465267504392

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.                ","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8566379,K99ES022986,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Neurology ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 year old ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2013,102242,MA-07,0.11673292426947562
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8484404,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,370345,WA-07,-0.007617991045371361
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,WA-07,-0.007617991045371361
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.            ",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8766404,R01HD081121,"['Algorithms ', ' Prostaglandin E1alpha ', ' Prostaglandin E1 ', ' Prost-13-en-1-oic acid, 11,15-dihydroxy-9-oxo-, (11alpha,13E,15S)- ', ' PGE1alpha ', ' PGE1 ', ' Muse ', ' Lipo-PGE1 ', ' Caverject ', ' Alprostadil ', ' Amides ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biomechanics ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Collagen ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elasticity ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fiber Optics ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mifeprex ', ' Mifegyne ', ' Mifepristone ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Phenotype ', ' physical science ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' L-Proline ', ' Proline ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Raman spectrometry ', ' Raman Spectroscopy ', ' IR/UV/Raman Spectroscopy ', ' Raman Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' para-Tyrosine ', ' L-isomer Tyrosine ', ' L-Tyrosine ', ' Tyrosine ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' High-Risk Pregnancy ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' Hormonal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Cervical Ripenings ', ' Cervical Ripening ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' RU486 ', ' RU38486 ', ' RU-38486 ', ' R38486 ', ' R 38486 ', ' RU-486 ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Reproductive Biology ', ' in vivo ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' mouse model ', ' pregnant ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' infant morbidity/mortality ', ' ']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,387356,TN-05,0.045384059340578604
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility. PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,9019684,R01LM009012,[''],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,358350,PA-03,0.021110465267504392
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.            ",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8815240,R01NS086885,"['Affect ', ' Afghanistan ', ' Amnesia-Memory Loss ', ' Amnesia ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Iraq ', ' Kinetics ', ' Methods ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Moods ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Rest ', ' Sports ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Measures ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Reliance ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Hemohistioblast ', ' Hemocytoblast ', ' Hematohistioblast ', ' Ferrata cell ', ' Blasts ', ' Blast Cell ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter damage ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,344166,NC-04,0.04744100302727626
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8670743,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2014,1739696,OH-01,0.08416662327306543

Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.            ",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9019135,R01HD086325,"['placental abruption ', ' Premature Separation of Placenta ', ' Abruptio Placentae ', ' Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Arteries ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Biopsy ', ' needle biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Communication ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Death ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnancy-Associated alpha-Plasma Protein ', ' PAPP-alpha ', ' PAPP-A ', ' Insulin-Like-Growth Factor Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Dependent IGF Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4-Specific Proteinase ', ' IGFBP-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4 Metalloproteinase ', ' Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A ', ' Production ', ' Research Institute ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Translations ', ' trophoblast ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Universities ', ' Viscosity ', ' Woman ', ' closed circular RNA ', ' circular RNA ', ' Transforming Growth Factor P Receptor III ', ' Endoglin (Osler-Rendu-Weber Syndrome 1) ', ' CD105 Antigen ', ' Endoglin ', ' Glean ', ' Baths ', ' Bathing ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood flow ', ' wasting ', ' fetus tissue ', ' Fetal Tissues ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.                ","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",8965058,R01CA190329,"['Affect ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665384,TX-02,0.026109390496746612
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,1735289,OH-01,0.08416662327306543
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.",Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis,8829259,R01ES017080,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' California ', ' Cells ', ' Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' CNS disorder ', ' CNS Diseases ', ' Central Nervous System Diseases ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chronology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' MHC Class II Genes ', ' MHC Class II ', ' HLA Class II Genes ', ' Class II Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Methods ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' MS (Multiple Sclerosis) ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Myelin ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Perinatal ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' cohort ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' neurological dysfunction ', ' Neurologic Dysfunctions ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' 6p21 ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' population based ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,572704,CA-13,0.014122407861212074
"Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Among the most intractable pregnancy pathologies are those related to aberrant trophoblast invasion and the subsequent remodeling of maternal vasculature at the utero-placental interface (UPI). These include preeclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abnormally invasive placenta (AIP, aka placenta accreta). Despite this, tools to measure placental structure and function in the crucial late first to early second trimester period have yet to be developed that can be translated from the research environment to routine clinical use. We are now constructing 3D power Doppler ultrasound technologies that provide real-time, quantitative assessment of placental structural and vascular development. We have developed novel semi- automated methods for calculation of placental volume (PlaV) and new methods to measure gross placental morphology (GPM; dimensions, surface area etc.) and to assess the vasculature at the UPI (Fractional Moving Blood Volume, FMBV). We propose four Aims intended to move the field towards routine imaging of placental structure and function in real time and to generate clinically useful tests for monitoring significant placental pathologies. In Aim 1, using machine learning techniques and an extant database of ~2800 1st trimester placental scans, we will fully automate the novel tools developed for measurement of PlaV into a real-time analytical package. Aim 2 will focus on 3D ultrasound techniques to interrogate the vasculature at the UPI through refinement of our new method for determining FMBV, a quantitative measure of vascularity. This will lead to a tool that can assess the entire UPI, a major site of pathology in PE, IUGR and AIP. We also aim to develop 3D power Doppler ultrasound tools for the examination of the size and distribution of the spiral artery jets feeding the intervillous space, enabling us to explore normal and pathological development of the intervillous supply in real-time. Aims 3 and 4 are prospective validation studies designed to test the utility of the tools described above. Aim 3 extends our recently published study of over-invasion of the maternal vasculature to the 1 /2 trimester. The presence and severity of AIP is assessed using Acon, the largest area of standard 3D power Doppler signal at the UPI. Under-invasion will be addressed via analysis of prospectively collected 11-13 week 3D-PD scans in women who develop PE. We will compare PlaV, GPM, FMBV and spiral artery jets in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. The prospective study in Aim 4 will address the environmental impact of smoking by comparing structural and vascular parameters between smokers and non-smokers at weekly intervals from 8-18 wks. These powerful longitudinal studies will map the development of morphologic and vascular features in smokers and non-smokers and provide new insights into the factors responsible for smoking-induced growth restriction. The strong investigative team, composed of bioengineers, maternal-fetal medicine specialists and placental biologists, is delivering these new tools in the research setting and is poised to generate new methods for clinical measurement of placental structure and vascular function in real-time.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If the placenta does not develop normally, complications like poor fetal growth and preeclampsia in the mother occur. We are developing new ultrasound techniques to measure the placenta early in pregnancy. This could permit early detection of problems that occur months later in the pregnancy. This would allow doctors to monitor the pregnancy and to prevent or treat problems quickly, before they have serious effects on the fetus.        ","Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology",9076751,U01HD087209,"['bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Decidua Graviditas ', ' Decidua ', ' Environment ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Hand ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Uterine Muscle ', ' myometrium ', ' Pathology ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta ', ' Placenta Accreta ', ' Placental Development ', ' Placentation ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' trophoblast ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Vascularization ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Doppler Ultrasound ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' normotensive ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Spiral Artery ', ' Spiral Artery of the Endometrium ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' feeding ', ' prospective ', ' implantation ', ' public health relevance ', ' fetal medicine ', ' screening ', ' ']",NICHD,HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2015,3316475,NJ-05,0.037233432285402525
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8925122,R01HD081121,"['Algorithms ', ' Prostaglandin E1alpha ', ' Prostaglandin E1 ', ' Prost-13-en-1-oic

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities among African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.            ",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities among African American Smokers,9009132,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,791875,TX-02,0.038351806768440085
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9044557,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' integrative health ', ' integrative healing ', ' Integrative Medicine ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2016,1729509,OH-01,0.08416662327306543
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.            ",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9127482,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cd element ', ' Cadmium ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Dentin ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Science of genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mn element ', ' Manganese ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Zinc ', ' Zn element ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Perinatal ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,708300,NY-13,0.10366691023210166
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9110914,R01CA190329,"['Affect ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' primary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,720845,TX-02,0.026109390496746612

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9026614,R00ES022986,"['abstracting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Neurology ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 7 year old ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2016,248999,MA-07,0.1166262631386315
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9145745,R01HD086325,"['placental abruption ', ' Premature Separation of Placenta ', ' Abruptio Placentae ', ' Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Arteries ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Biopsy ', ' needle biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Communication ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Death ', ' Fetal Development ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnancy-Associated alpha-Plasma Protein ', ' PAPP-alpha ', ' PAPP-A ', ' Insulin-Like-Growth Factor Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Dependent IGF Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4-Specific Proteinase ', ' IGFBP-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4 Metalloproteinase ', ' Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A ', ' Production ', ' Research Institute ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Translations ', ' trophoblast ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Universities ', ' Viscosity ', ' Woman ', ' circular RNA ', ' closed circular RNA ', ' Endoglin ', ' Transforming Growth Factor P Receptor III ', ' CD105 Antigen ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Glean ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood flow ', ' wasting ', ' fetus tissue ', ' Fetal Tissues ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Welding ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Occupational ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Prevention ', ' Intoxication ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' air sampling ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' translational impact ', ' ']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,IN-04,0.04711915752092734
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9443649,R01HD081121,"['Algorithms ', ' Prostaglandin E1alpha ', ' Prostaglandin E1 ', ' PGE1alpha ', ' PGE1

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Opiates ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,NC-04,0.02130751415792489
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Miscarriage ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Archives ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' diethylhexylphthalate ', ' Dioctyl Phthalate ', ' Di-2-Ethylhexylphthalate ', ' DEHP ', ' Diethylhexyl Phthalate ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' Choriogonadotropin ', ' Chorionic Gonadotropin ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Illinois ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9189610,R00ES022986,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nail plate ', ' Nails ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' 4 year old ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 7 year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 years of age ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen years of age ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 years of age ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2017,248999,MA-07,0.1166262631386315
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9212418,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Cd element ', ' Cadmium ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,792334,MA-07,0.016441608413756234
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums.

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Cognition ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,NY-13,0.042627456884174596
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9325617,R01NS086885,"['Affect ', ' Afghanistan ', ' Amnesia-Memory Loss ', ' Amnesia ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Iraq ', ' Kinetics ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rest ', ' Sports ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Measures ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Blast Cell ', ' Hemohistioblast ', ' Hemocytoblast ', ' Hematohistioblast ', ' Ferrata cell ', ' Blasts ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter damage ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive task ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' mild TBI ', ' MTBI ', ' concussive symptom ', ' concussion symptom ', ' persistent symptom ', ' chronic symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' mechanical force ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,347813,NC-04,0.04744100302727626
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Pathology ', ' Placenta ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placentation ', ' Placental Development ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxin ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Pollution ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' implantation ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' exosome ', ' predictive signature ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,651353,CA-33,0.1260695783963941
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9269122,R01HD086325,"['placental abruption ', ' Premature Separation of Placenta ', ' Abruptio Placentae ', ' Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Arteries ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Biopsy ', ' needle biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Communication ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Death ', ' Fetal Development ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Placenta ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A ', ' Pregnancy-Associated alpha-Plasma Protein ', ' PAPP-alpha ', ' PAPP-A ', ' Insulin-Like-Growth Factor Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Dependent IGF Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4-Specific Proteinase ', ' IGFBP-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4 Metalloproteinase ', ' Production ', ' Research Institute ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Translations ', ' trophoblast ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Universities ', ' Viscosity ', ' Woman ', ' closed circular RNA ', ' circular RNA ', ' Transforming Growth Factor P Receptor III ', ' CD105 Antigen ', ' Endoglin ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Glean ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood flow ', ' wasting ', ' fetus tissue ', ' Fetal Tissues ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Sorting -

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9537132,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Poverty ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,810198,UT-02,0.038351806768440085
"Center for Environmental Genetics This application requests a 5-year renewal of the Center for Environmental Genetics.

"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9610235,R21ES029791,"['Algorithms ', ' Arsenic ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Cytology ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Holography ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Descriptor ', ' Image Cytometry ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' parallel processing ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cytometry ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' shear stress ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Microfluidic ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Data ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Resolution ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' systems research ', ' digital ', ' toxic metal ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computer ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' mechanical properties ', ' imaging approach ', ' ']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209312,NC-04,0.04167342851859409
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9554621,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' Work ', ' Zinc ', ' Zn element ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' eight years of age ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' 8 years of age ', ' 8 year old ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' high dimensionality ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,633419,NY-13,0.10366691023210166
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9390493,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Poverty ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' data to knowledge ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,740378,UT-02,0.038351806768440085
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9526722,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,186408,CA-18,0.07061767527174308
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9517056,K99ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' health data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2018,98444,NY-13,0.042627456884174596
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9505946,R01HD081121,"['Algorithms ', ' Alprostadil ', ' Prostaglandin E1alpha ', ' Prostaglandin E1 ', '

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9440248,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussian model ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,506174,TX-02,0.10448076517473853
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Safety ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Welding ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Toenail ', ' Toe Nail ', ' Structure of nail of toe ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Occupational ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Prevention ', ' Intoxication ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' air sampling ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' translational impact ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' ']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,IN-04,0.04711915752092734
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9573304,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,755603,MA-07,0.016441608413756234
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9583334,K99HD096125,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9519600,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9761612,R00ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' health data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2018,247463,NY-13,0.042627456884174596
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9503015,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae ', ' placental abruption ', ' Premature Separation of Placenta ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Arteries ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Communication ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Placenta ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' placental disorders ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A ', ' Pregnancy-Associated alpha-Plasma Protein ', ' PAPP-alpha ', ' PAPP-A ', ' Insulin-Like-Growth Factor Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Dependent IGF Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4-Specific Proteinase ', ' IGFBP-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4 Metalloproteinase ', ' Production ', ' Research Institute ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Translations ', ' trophoblast ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Universities ', ' Viscosity ', ' Woman ', ' circular RNA ', ' closed circular RNA ', ' Endoglin ', ' Transforming Growth Factor P Receptor III ', ' CD105 Antigen ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Glean ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood flow ', ' wasting ', ' fetus tissue ', ' Fetal Tissues ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Sorting -

"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' California ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Humidity ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicaid ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' cypermethrin ', ' supermethrin ', ' supercypermethrin ', ' Permethrin ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Ingestion ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' case control ', ' Melissa ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' urinary ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Learning Skill ', ' study population ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,AZ-03,0.07078344602203628
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9520444,R01NS086885,"['Affect ', ' Afghanistan ', ' Amnesia ', ' Amnesia-Memory Loss ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Iraq ', ' Kinetics ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rest ', ' Sports ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Unconscious State ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Measures ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Blast Cell ', ' Hemohistioblast ', ' Hemocytoblast ', ' Hematohistioblast ', ' Ferrata cell ', ' Blasts ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter damage ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive task ', ' mild brain trauma ', ' mild TBI ', ' MTBI ', ' mild traumatic brain injury ', ' concussion symptom ', ' concussive symptom ', ' chronic symptom ', ' persistent symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' mechanical force ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347813,NC-04,0.04744100302727626
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' drug abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' abused drug ', ' drug of abuse ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' effective intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning ability ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' maternal care giving ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,NC-04,0.02130751415792489
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9626424,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,499515,TX-02,0.10448076517473853
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and

"3/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study ABSTRACT Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' drug abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' abused drug ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,NC-04,0.02130751415792489
"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9732537,R21ES029791,"['Arsenic ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Computers ', ' Cytology ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Holography ', ' instrumentation ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Descriptor ', ' Image Cytometry ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' parallel processing ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cytometry ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' shear stress ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Data ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Resolution ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' systems research ', ' digital ', ' toxic metal ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' nanoscale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computation ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' mechanical properties ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine vision ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,194177,NC-04,0.04167342851859409
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9675335,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient response ', ' responsive patient ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,186408,CA-18,0.07061767527174308
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9974957,K99HD096125,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' maternal death ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Safety ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Epidemiological Research Design ', ' Epidemiologic Research Design ', ' Testing ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Testosterone ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cyclooxygenase 2 ', ' prostaglandin H synthase-2 ', ' cyclo-oxygenase II ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 ', ' PHS II ', ' PGHS2 ', ' PGH Synthase 2 ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 ', ' COX2 enzyme ', ' COX-2 protein ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Vioxx ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' time use ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' population health ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trend analysis ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,PA-03,0.048966846228350056
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9767585,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mn element ', ' Manganese ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Work ', ' Zn element ', ' Zinc ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Chemicals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' 8 years of age ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' high dimensionality ', ' perinatal period ', ' perinatal phase ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,608605,NY-13,0.10366691023210166
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,NY-13,0.042627456884174596
"2/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' California ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Humidity ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicaid ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' supermethrin ', ' supercypermethrin ', ' cypermethrin ', ' Permethrin ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Excretory function ', ' excretion ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Ingestion ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' case control ', ' Melissa ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' urinary ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Learning Skill ', ' study population ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,AZ-03,0.07078344602203628
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9701262,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae ', ' placental abruption ', ' Premature Separation of Placenta ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Arteries ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Communication ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Death ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta ', ' placental disorders ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnancy-Associated alpha-Plasma Protein ', ' PAPP-alpha ', ' PAPP-A ', ' Insulin-Like-Growth Factor Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Dependent IGF Binding Protein-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4-Specific Proteinase ', ' IGFBP-4 Protease ', ' IGFBP-4 Metalloproteinase ', ' Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A ', ' Production ', ' Research Institute ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Translations ', ' trophoblast ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Universities ', ' womb ', ' Uterus ', ' Viscosity ', ' Woman ', ' closed circular RNA ', ' circular RNA ', ' Transforming Growth Factor P Receptor III ', ' CD105 Antigen ', ' Endoglin ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Glean ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Premature Birth ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood flow ', ' wasting ', ' Fetal Tissues ', ' fetus tissue ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Sorting -

"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arsenic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood -

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Maternal and Child Health ', ' Process ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' perinatal morbidity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' data resource ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Birth Records ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Parents ', ' perinatal deaths ', ' Perinatal lethality ', ' Perinatal Mortalities ', ' Perinatal mortality demographics ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' pollutant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,TX-02,0.1199692164573006

To prepare for this large study, we have formed a group of 5 institutions that will develop strategies, conduct pilot studies, and analyze available data to guide the future study design.","1/5, HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study",9900350,R34DA050262,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arkansas ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Meconium ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' North Carolina ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Psychologist ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Quality Control ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Institute ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Standardization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Umbilical Cord ', ' Umbilical cord structure ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' pediatrician ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' postnatal ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' drug exposure in utero ', ' in uteri drug exposure ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' in utero ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' fetal drug exposure ', ' prenatally drug exposed ', ' prenatal drug exposure ', ' gestational drug exposure ', ' fetal opioid exposure ', ' prenatally opiate exposed ', ' prenatal opioid exposure ', ' prenatal opiate exposure ', ' gestational opioid exposure ', ' gestational opiate exposure ', ' fetal opiate exposures ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive development ', ' opioid use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opioid exposure ', ' opioid exposed ', ' opiate exposure ', ' opiate exposed ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' recruit ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' phase 2 designs ', ' phase II designs ', ' childhood adversity ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R34,2019,262407,NC-04,0.013473933836140147
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9623075,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,742640,UT-02,0.038351806768440085
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9749156,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mn element ', ' Manganese ', ' Hg element ', ' Mercury ', ' Metals ', ' NO3- ', ' Nitrates ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,708647,MA-07,0.016441608413756234
"4/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design. Upon completion of the proposed aims, our consortium will be in an ideal position to conduct the future Phase II study.

"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Preterm Birth (PTB) is a major long-lasting public health problem being the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates, with heavy emotional and financial consequences to families and society. Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions. The challenge of improving PTB prediction is due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. We plan on devising longitudinal risk prediction methods for PTB that integrate every piece of available data. We will address three important gaps in current literature as our three project objectives: a focused study of nulliparous women and their risk for PTB; combining genetic factors with other clinical factors to determine risk ; and using longitudinal data and models to optimize scheduling of patient visits, testing and treatment. We will focus on a recently released NIH-NICHD dataset called nuMoM2b, which is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse  population of10 ,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestation . Our aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction ; (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction ; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice. RELEVANCE (See instructions) . Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of

"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10034502,R01ES032140,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Carbon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Europe ', ' Health ', ' Personal Health Records ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Meteorology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nickel ', ' Ni element ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' North America ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Tennessee ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Urbanization ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' indoor air contamination ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pollution ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Sulfate ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' super computing ', ' Supercomputing ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' years of life lost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' effective intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' study population ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' fine particles ', ' ']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,615182,GA-05,0.06857842599625566
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hurricane ', ' indexing ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Pesticides ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Water Purification ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' water treatment ', ' contaminant transport ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' superfund chemical ', ' superfund site ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' remediation ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Superfund ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated water ', ' drinking water contamination ', ' contaminated drinking water ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' community involvement ', ' Data Management System ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' extreme weather ', ' ']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,MA-07,0.09113674300080918
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9851750,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Poverty ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' data to knowledge ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social cohesion ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,849960,UT-02,0.038351806768440085
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism ', ' Affect ', ' Asia ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Birth Weight ', ' California ', ' Canada ', ' Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Esthetics ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' drinking water ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' neurotoxic ', ' infant outcome ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' demographics ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' environmental justice ', ' population health ', ' Secure ', ' Geology Survey ', ' geological applications ', ' geological characterization ', ' geology characterization ', ' Geological Survey ', ' school district ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated water ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Child Health ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,CA-41,0.05122412313362067
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Folic Acid ', ' Folate ', ' Pteroylglutamic Acid ', ' Vitamin M ', ' vitamin Bc ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylmercury Compounds ', ' Methyl Mercury Compounds ', ' methylmercury ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Vitamin B 12 ', ' Cyanocobalamin ', ' VIT B12 ', ' Vitamin B12 ', ' Measures ', ' Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Chemicals ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Nutrient ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' offspring ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Modeling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' in utero ', ' cost ', ' prenatal environmental exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Child Neurotoxicity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' 3 year old ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' learning ability ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' methylation marker ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' cognitive ability ', ' cognitive burden ', ' cognitive load ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker development ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neurodevelopment effect ', ' neurodevelopmental effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,CA-13,0.05854210579386956
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biologicalpathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10273235,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Data Science ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,608093,IN-02,0.10448076517473853
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gases ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' North Carolina ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' smoke inhalation ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' experience ', ' genotoxicity ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Toxicogenomics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Chemically Induced Toxicity ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Wildfire ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' data reduction ', ' biomass smoke ', ' biomass fuel ', ' protein markers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' computational toxicology ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,NC-04,0.015212181366577924
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Safety ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Epidemiologic Research Design ', ' Epidemiological Research Design ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' COX-2 protein ', ' COX2 enzyme ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 ', ' PGH Synthase 2 ', ' PGHS2 ', ' PHS II ', ' Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 ', ' cyclo-oxygenase II ', ' prostaglandin H synthase-2 ', ' cyclooxygenase 2 ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Vioxx ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' time use ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' nondrug ', ' non-drug ', ' population health ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' trend analysis ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Time trend ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,PA-03,0.048966846228350056
"The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Determinants of Vulnerability to Environmental Stress Among the Elderly ADRD Population As individuals live longer, healthier lives, the number of people living with, and dying from, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has risen. AD prevalence and mortality are expected to continue to rise in the future. However, while AD is fatal and individuals living with AD have high mortality rates, their immediate cause of death is usually respiratory disease or ischemic heart disease rather than dementia. Consequently, improving the health and quality of life of people living with ADRD depends on understanding their vulnerability to these diseases, and how these conditions interact with their dementia. Our proposed study focuses on the determinants of health and mortality among those in the Medicare population who have been identified as living with ADRD. Because cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been identified as frequent causes of death among the ADRD population, we focus on an environmental stressor that increases the likelihood of death due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes: acute exposure to air pollution. Using a large dataset of Medicare beneficiaries and machine-learning techniques applied to quasi-random variation in pollution exposure generated by changes in local wind direction, we find that acute exposure to air pollution increases mortality risk for only about one quarter of the elderly. While individuals living with ADRD are much more likely to be in this vulnerable group than the typical Medicare beneficiary, we find that acute air pollution exposure does not increase mortality risk for a large fraction (44%) of Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data, local characteristics, and atmospheric variables in order to understand why some individuals living with ADRD suffer harm from the increased cardiovascular and respiratory stress induced by air pollution exposure while others do not. These factors, once identified and verified in continuing research, will provide guidance that can improve the health and quality of life of individuals living with ADRD by better directing resources to those most in need and guiding interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards. As part of the project, we will develop a publicly available database that provides the following data at the ZIP code level: ADRD prevalence, vulnerability to air pollution exposure among the ADRD population, and ZIP code level characteristics that have been shown to affect vulnerability. Other researchers can then use this data for any other study seeking to understand the effects of geographically defined factors or policies on the ADRD population. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative While Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal form of dementia, the top two immediate causes of death for people with Alzheimer’s disease are respiratory illness (55.5%) and ischemic heart disease (23.1%), which are both exacerbated by exposure to environmental hazards such as air pollution. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data in order to identify risk factors that predict vulnerability to the harmful effects of pollution exposure for individuals living with ADRD, allowing for better targeting of resources to those most in need and contributing to the improvement of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards.","The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly",10123225,R01AG053350,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Temperature ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pollution ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' respiratory ', ' environmental stressor ', ' hazard ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2020,376508,MA-05,-0.03884112368689083
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,9911103,F31HL151178,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking Status ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' biracial ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' informatics tool ', ' social factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2020,40733,IL-07,0.01691398214318091

We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users. Ultimately, this  Aim will allow for the assessment and monitoring of CyanoHAB conditions for any waterbody or  region (i.e., North America) on the planet. Specific Aim #3: Execute risk assessment frameworks with public health partners  • We will work in partnership with Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,  University of Miami, Macquarie University, NIH’s Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section and  CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (National ALS Registry) to assess the role  of CyanoHABs exposure as a risk factor for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using patients,  clinic-, and population-based controls across diverse settings and geographies. Each application  end user has ongoing risk assessment frameworks (i.e., Gene-Environment, Residential History  Machine Learning, eco-epidemiological, molecular biology) which our CHABMAP technology will  integrate exposure epoch metrics to understand the etiology or ALS and support drug discovery. Proposed Innovation CHABMAP technology automates the quantification of toxic Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom (CHAB) exposure epochs for any waterbody or catchment in the world for the past four decades using multi-scale harmonized satellites. We use custom and proprietary techniques combined with BigData software to generate historical exposure (“exposome”) profiles as well provide Decision Support Tools services for CHAB monitoring in near-real time. During Phase 2 and beyond we work with world experts to integrate our commercial products and services into neurodegenerative disease Gene-Environment (GxE) risk assessment frameworks. Proposed Products, Services, Outcomes  • Develop historical CHAB exposure measurements working with environmental agency partners  • Assessment of CyanoHABs as a risk factor for ALS across multiple, independent study regions  • CHABMAP on-demand Analytics-as-a-Service platform operating at end of Phase 2  • Support discovery of etiology and drug development for neurological disorders and diseases Project Narrative Design, build, and operate a cloud-based Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analysis Platform (CHAB-MAP) for developing public health applications’ in partnership with NASA, EPA, and medical centers.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,10005934,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Work ', ' Zinc ', ' Zn element ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' 8 year old ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' high dimensionality ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' neurodevelopment effect ', ' neurodevelopmental effect ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,604973,NY-13,0.10366691023210166
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9882999,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Data Science ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1,TX-02,0.10448076517473853
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.

"Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes SUMMARY The diet quality of U.S. childbearing aged women is worse now than any time in the last 50 years. Poor diet quality has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes that contribute to infant mortality and pose a tremendous societal burden. Nevertheless, formal recommendations on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes are lacking. The US Congress recently mandated that dietary advice for pregnancy be included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the major nutrition policy document that provides dietary advice for health promotion. The USDA/HHS Pregnancy Work Group, which included PI Lisa Bodnar, was charged with summarizing existing knowledge on diet patterns that support healthy pregnancy outcomes to inform the pregnancy-specific guidelines. They identified an evidence base that was entirely insufficient for deriving empirical recommendations and called for research to fill this critical knowledge gap. Our objective is to generate empirical evidence that will inform national dietary guidance on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesize that our results will suggest dietary recommendations for pregnant women that will diverge from prevailing nutrition advice. We expect this divergence because our innovative approaches will accommodate the complex synergy among foods in the diet. Using a large, prospective cohort of 7995 U.S. women enrolled at 8 U.S. academic centers, we will quantify the contribution of dietary patterns to variation in risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth <37 weeks, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia). We will use machine learning techniques that allow for complex interactions among dietary components. Then, we will generalize recommended dietary patterns in our sample to the U.S. population of pregnant women using cutting edge “transportability” methods developed in the causal inference literature. Finally, we will develop machine learning algorithms that will identify subgroups who will benefit most from dietary pattern recommendations. The successful completion of this project will provide the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee with empirically-derived data on the ideal dietary patterns for promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes. Our innovative methodologies will serve as a template for nutritional epidemiologists in other areas of health to apply to their data, leading to a broad impact on the Dietary Guidelines. Developing practical data-driven dietary recommendations to optimize pregnancy outcomes will help to reduce the high economic and societal burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve the health of mothers and their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is the cornerstone of nutrition policy in the U.S., impacting WIC and other Federal nutrition assistance programs, health insurance incentives, weight and lifestyle interventions, policies to change the food environment, and nutrition education programs at the national, regional, state and local levels. This project will inform the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines by using cutting-edge analytic approaches to identify diet patterns that promote healthy outcomes of pregnancy. Although the causes of poor pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial, we focus on dietary intake because it is one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors, and has important implications for mother and child well beyond the childbearing years.",Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes,10026261,R01HD102313,"['Accounting ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Charge ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Conceptions ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Economics ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incentives ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Small for Gestational Age Infant ', ' small for gestational age ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Nulliparity ', ' Nulliparas ', ' Nulliparous ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Requirements ', ' nutrient requirement ', ' Oils ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Planned Pregnancy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Policies ', ' nutritional care ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant demise ', ' infantile death ', ' infant death ', ' American ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' dietary control ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Component ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' bear children ', ' bearing children ', ' childbearing ', ' child bearing ', ' modifiable risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' pregnant ', ' evidence base ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' food environment ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' healthy pregnancy ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' health of the mother ', ' dietary guidelines ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' WIC ', ' WIC program ', ' Women, Infants and Children (WIC) ', ' Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,645069,PA-18,0.04571267543031933
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Pathology ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' placental disorders ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placentation ', ' Placental Development ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxin ', ' Measures ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Pollution ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' implantation ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' exosome ', ' predictive signature ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,623441,CA-33,0.1260695783963941
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9933925,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' 3rd grade ', ' third grade ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' random forest ', ' multiple data types ', ' adverse birth outcomes ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' big-data science ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,NY-13,0.042627456884174596
"Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S. NEW EVIDENCE ON CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY LOSS IN THE U.S. ABSTRACT Conception failure and pregnancy loss impede the pathway to parenthood for millions of US couples each year. Despite being modifiable and common—pregnancy loss occurs fifty times as often as infant mortality— miscarriage is among the least well-studied aspects of population health or population dynamics. We know little about what causes these losses, the generalizability of estimates generated from the study of small recruited samples, including how the risk of miscarriage differs across time, place, or subpopulation.  These enormous gaps are driven by how difficult it is to study the pathway to live birth in humans, requiring a sufficiently large and diverse “preconception cohort.” To date small, nonrepresentative cohorts contribute most of what we know about early pregnancy. But limited sample size, variation, and coverage preclude the study of social and ecological factors—poverty, partner health, environmental exposures—that are now widely understood to shape mortality at later ages: e.g., stillbirth, infant, and child mortality. Such omissions are consequential. Conception failures and pregnancy loss have significant emotional and economic costs. Though pregnancy failures are likely distributed unevenly across populations, the size of this disparate burden is unknown. We do not have evidence about the potential impact of policies on the prevention of these outcomes.  Our research combines the tools of data science and social science to scale the preconception design to a large, diverse cohort in the US. Period and pregnancy “tracking” on digital devices is now common among reproductive-age women. We use data on 4 million women’s day-to-day recording of menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy, as well as reported social and economic characteristics. The data allow us to measure both reported and detected conception and pregnancy loss. We combine the data with georeferenced information about the physical, social, economic, and policy environments in which women and their partners live. The sample is diverse: users come from over 99% of U.S. counties; over 1 million users are on Medicaid. We use these extraordinary data to provide the first estimates of large-scale population variability in the pathway to live birth and to document factors that affect this pathway. Aim 1 develops new estimates of conception and pregnancy loss, including disparities associated with education, income, racial identification, and neighborhood poverty. Aim 2 estimates the contribution of male partner characteristics to conception and pregnancy loss, drawing on detailed data reported about partners. Aim 3 uses quasi-experimental designs to provide the first estimates of understudied exposures from multiple environmental, social, economic domains on conception and pregnancy loss. The research sheds new light on a pervasive and massively understudied public health concern, with direct implications for the improvement of early pregnancy outcomes. In so doing, the research also generates estimates that are much-needed inputs to support advancement in multiple, connected fields of study in the social, health, and biomedical sciences. NARRATIVE Conception failure and miscarriage affect millions of U.S. couples each year. This research uses new georeferenced data on pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy for 4 million U.S. women to provide the first evidence on individual, family, ecological, and policy factors that reduce the risk of early pregnancy failure.",Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S.,9998409,R01HD102207,"['Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Couples ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fecundity ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Inflammation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' male ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Ovulation ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Rural Community ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Live Birth ', ' stillborn ', ' stillbirth ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' economic cost ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Consequentialism ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Fertility Study ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' pregnant ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Data Science ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' tribal lands ', ' recruit ', ' early pregnancy ', ' prepregnancy ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' failed pregnancy ', ' pregnancy failure ', ' trying to conceive ', ' social factors ', ' data tools ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,315760,WI-02,0.06209493874094984
"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9904774,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,186408,CA-18,0.07061767527174308
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution

"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,9873121,R21AR076612,"['Affect ', ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Activation ', ' complement pathway regulation ', ' Conceptions ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Europe ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' France ', ' Future ', ' Germany ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Laboratories ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity -

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9981740,R01ES027747,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Sulfate ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cohort ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,757233,MA-07,0.016441608413756234
"A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women ABSTRACT African-American women bear a disproportionate burden of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, regardless of socio-economic, educational, or marital status. Fortunately, maternal death rarely occurs without warning. Pregnancy complications, such as those that increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease (preterm birth, growth restriction, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes), or severe maternal morbidity (SMM) can serve as sentinel events that herald the impending possibility of a mother's increased risk for maternal mortality (MM). Most health disparities studies to date have used a deficit-based model and have included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African-American women with healthy pregnancy outcomes as the reference group. I will compare them to African American women with pregnancy complications to identify protective factors because African American women with healthy pregnancies may provide key insight to inform future prevention strategies. The objective of this supplement is to identify environmental, systems, behavioral, medical, and biological constructs that predict a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy in African- American women. The proposed supplemental study leverages a rich repository of clinical, survey and biospecimen data from a contemporary cohort of 852 African American women enrolled in an observational preterm birth study from 2017-2020, 549 (64%) of whom went on to have a healthy pregnancy, free from complications that predict future cardiovascular disease. I will use two complementary approaches, multi-level modeling and machine learning, to quantify the relative contributions of modifiable protective factors to a healthy pregnancy across multiple levels and domains of influence. Using an adaptation of the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities Research Framework, I will identify factors that protect African-American women from pregnancy complications that predict future cardiovascular disease (Aim 1.1), SMM (Aim 1.2), and a composite morbidity index combining the two (Aim 1.3). Finally, the work of interpreting the empirical findings from Aim 1, to develop potential interventions and policy changes, will begin in Aim 2. This aim is aspirational in nature, but included in this brief supplement to stress the importance of identifying actionable items from study findings of protective factors that are most amenable to targeting through interventions and/or health policy. A team of diverse stakeholders, including a Maternal Advisory Panel of African American Mothers, Clinicians, and Perinatal Researchers will use intervention mapping (a rigorous method that has been used to create behavioral health interventions) to review study findings, methodically think through ways to translate study findings into action, and make recommendations for future directions that are most likely to promote health equity for African American mothers. 1 NARRATIVE Most health disparities studies that have attempted to identify factors that explain the higher rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality among African-American women have used a deficit-based model and included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African American women with healthy pregnancies as the reference group to identify protective factors that can be targeted through the design of future interventions to promote health equity. 1",A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women,10200462,K23HD095075,"['Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hematology ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Life Experience ', ' Marital Status ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' respiratory ', ' Consult ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' reproductive ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Modification ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' pregnant ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' healthy pregnancy ', ' protective factors ', ' early pregnancy ', ' health goals ', ' maternal risk ', ' severe maternal morbidity ', ' ']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162000,MO-01,0.03131591899692919
"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help enhance health and reduce the burdens of human illness.",A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support,10057086,R21HD103039,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Couples ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eastern Europe ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ownership ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Tests ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Romania ', ' Self Determination ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' postnatal ', ' System ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' offspring ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' International ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tobacco control ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' iterative design ', ' arm ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' public health intervention ', ' peer support ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' adaptive learning ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' prenatal smoking ', ' smoking during pregnancy ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' prepregnancy ', ' pregnant cigarette smoker ', ' pregnant smoker ', ' prenatal cigarette smoking ', ' ']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,210787,MI-08,0.01839483021731506
