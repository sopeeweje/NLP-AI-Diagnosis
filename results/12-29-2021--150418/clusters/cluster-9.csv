"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative/Relevance We will develop computational tools for analyzing complex associations between images, genotype and clinical phenotype. The tools will be user-friendly and freely available, and will potentially facilitate accurate early diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders such as Alzheimer's.             ",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8165447,K25EB013649,"['Genetic Research ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Probability ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Genetic Risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Motivation ', ' image processing ', ' Mining ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Goals ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' high risk ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Cognitive ', ' Complex ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' interest ', ' Testing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Training ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' base ', ' Foundations ', ' Clinical ', ' programs ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Individual ', ' career ', ' genetic variant ', ' Exhibits ', ' Phase ', ' Risk ', ' tool ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Measurement ', ' Future ', ' Methods ', ' Genes ', ' Outcome ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Pattern ', ' Event ', ' Algorithms ', ' Genotype ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Pathology ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' improved ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Patients ', ' Sample Size ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Modeling ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' data modeling ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2011,175392,MA-08,-0.05713266749658182
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.              Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Improving the Detection of Activation in High Resolution fMRI using Multivariate     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a local multivariate analysis software package for fMRI data analysis. It will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods. This project will lead to better brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function. Mass-univariate analysis, such as the general linear model (GLM), is the prevailing fMRI data analysis method. However, it suffers from blurring of edges of activation and potential elimination of the detection of weak activated regions due to routinely applied fixed isotropic spatial Gaussian smoothing. Local multivariate methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants have been shown to significantly increase the detection power of fMRI activations and improve activation maps. As an advantage, CCA uses adaptive spatial filtering kernels to accurately extract the signal better in a noisy environment. However, there are several drawbacks, particularly low spatial specificity, long computational time, and single-factor experimental design limitation. Furthermore, a parametric estimation method does not exist to determine the family-wise error rate, no extension to group analysis has been investigated, and no studies extending local CCA to nonlinear CCA for fMRI data using kernel methods have been systematically carried out. All these drawbacks prevent local CCA methods from being widely accepted in neuroscience research in fMRI. In this proposal, our goals are to eliminate these drawbacks using novel local multivariate analysis methods (based on CCA) and to develop a software tool to widen its broader application in the neuroscience research community. We expect this software tool to be particularly valuable for neuroscience research where detections of weak activations or spatially localized patterns of activations are desired. As high resolution imaging and computer power advance, we expect an increase in demand for this software tool, thus advancing new discoveries of brain function and more precise spatial localization of activations. As a particular application, we will focus on studying memory actions using a novel event-related recognition paradigm to investigate the effects of familiarity and recollection in subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) for high resolution fMRI. This research will advance our understanding of hippocampal/MTL contributions to memory, which can substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer¿s disease, schizophrenia, and major depression. More generally, it will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow better analysis of high-resolution fMRI data leading to better characterization of cortical function. For this project we choose to focus on studying memory activation in the medial temporal lobes using high-resolution imaging and multivariate analysis which could substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and major depression.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.        Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"Improving the Detection of Activation in High Resolution fMRI using Multivariate     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a local multivariate analysis software package for fMRI data analysis. It will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods. This project will lead to better brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function. Mass-univariate analysis, such as the general linear model (GLM), is the prevailing fMRI data analysis method. However, it suffers from blurring of edges of activation and potential elimination of the detection of weak activated regions due to routinely applied fixed isotropic spatial Gaussian smoothing. Local multivariate methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants have been shown to significantly increase the detection power of fMRI activations and improve activation maps. As an advantage, CCA uses adaptive spatial filtering kernels to accurately extract the signal better in a noisy environment. However, there are several drawbacks, particularly low spatial specificity, long computational time, and single-factor experimental design limitation. Furthermore, a parametric estimation method does not exist to determine the family-wise error rate, no extension to group analysis has been investigated, and no studies extending local CCA to nonlinear CCA for fMRI data using kernel methods have been systematically carried out. All these drawbacks prevent local CCA methods from being widely accepted in neuroscience research in fMRI. In this proposal, our goals are to eliminate these drawbacks using novel local multivariate analysis methods (based on CCA) and to develop a software tool to widen its broader application in the neuroscience research community. We expect this software tool to be particularly valuable for neuroscience research where detections of weak activations or spatially localized patterns of activations are desired. As high resolution imaging and computer power advance, we expect an increase in demand for this software tool, thus advancing new discoveries of brain function and more precise spatial localization of activations. As a particular application, we will focus on studying memory actions using a novel event-related recognition paradigm to investigate the effects of familiarity and recollection in subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) for high resolution fMRI. This research will advance our understanding of hippocampal/MTL contributions to memory, which can substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer¿s disease, schizophrenia, and major depression. More generally, it will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow better analysis of high-resolution fMRI data leading to better characterization of cortical function. For this project we choose to focus on studying memory activation in the medial temporal lobes using high-resolution imaging and multivariate analysis which could substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and major depression. Our proposed fMRI analysis methods also have great potential for significantly advancing our understanding of other neurological and psychiatric conditions.                ",Improving the Detection of Activation in High Resolution fMRI using Multivariate,8656325,R01EB014284,"['Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Solutions ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' temporal lobe/cortex ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Medial ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' memory recognition ', ' Recognition (Psychology) ', ' interest ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Familiarity ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' ']",NIBIB,RYERSON  UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,65141,,0.02425165199351522
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.

"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets.

"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent.

Developing new computational methods for investigating causal interactions in fMRI data has therefore taken added significance; the overall goal of this proposal is to address this critical need by developing new methods for studying causal interactions and brain connectivity between distributed brain regions during cognition.",Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction,8866489,R01NS086085,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Markov Process ', ' Markov Chains ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo technique ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo method ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo computational algorithm ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' in vivo ', ' Experimental Genetics ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Computational Science ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' optogenetics ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Big Data ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,507610,CA-18,-0.07591082748342871
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.                ",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,8956794,R01MH107741,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' indexing ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vector ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' neuropsychological ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,382086,MI-12,-0.0007429672195829759
"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.",Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders,8847802,K01MH094689,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Attention ', ' auditory pathway ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Diffusion ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' Independent Living ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Mentors ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Societies ', ' temporal lobe/cortex ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gur ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Mediating ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' career ', ' Dorsal ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Marshal ', ' interest ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuroimaging ', ' human developmental psychology ', ' developmental psychology ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' social ', ' Ruthenium Ben ', ' RuCl2(C6H6)(dmso) ', ' RuBen ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' social cognition ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Social Functioning ', ' functional outcomes ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' social communication ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' language processing ', ' neuropsychological ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2015,168157,PA-03,-0.011772426155371787
"Administrative Supplement to 1R03MH105765: Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities. The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.",Administrative Supplement to 1R03MH105765: Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,9076865,R03MH105765,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biology ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Maps ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Quality Control ', ' Rest ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Science ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Chronic Schizophrenia ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' DSM ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,35293,CT-03,0.04705558800867849
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Training ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Measurement ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Episodic memory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathological aging ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive system ', ' normal aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,NY-13,0.001680817123445536
"Improving the Detection of Activation in High Resolution fMRI using Multivariate DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a local multivariate analysis software package for fMRI data analysis. It will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods. This project will lead to better brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function. Mass-univariate analysis, such as the general linear model (GLM), is the prevailing fMRI data analysis method. However, it suffers from blurring of edges of activation and potential elimination of the detection of weak activated regions due to routinely applied fixed isotropic spatial Gaussian smoothing. Local multivariate methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants have been shown to significantly increase the detection power of fMRI activations and improve activation maps. As an advantage, CCA uses adaptive spatial filtering kernels to accurately extract the signal better in a noisy environment. However, there are several drawbacks, particularly low spatial specificity, long computational time, and single-factor experimental design limitation. Furthermore, a parametric estimation method does not exist to determine the family-wise error rate, no extension to group analysis has been investigated, and no studies extending local CCA to nonlinear CCA for fMRI data using kernel methods have been systematically carried out. All these drawbacks prevent local CCA methods from being widely accepted in neuroscience research in fMRI. In this proposal, our goals are to eliminate these drawbacks using novel local multivariate analysis methods (based on CCA) and to develop a software tool to widen its broader application in the neuroscience research community. We expect this software tool to be particularly valuable for neuroscience research where detections of weak activations or spatially localized patterns of activations are desired. As high resolution imaging and computer power advance, we expect an increase in demand for this software tool, thus advancing new discoveries of brain function and more precise spatial localization of activations. As a particular application, we will focus on studying memory actions using a novel event-related recognition paradigm to investigate the effects of familiarity and recollection in subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) for high resolution fMRI. This research will advance our understanding of hippocampal/MTL contributions to memory, which can substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer¿s disease, schizophrenia, and major depression. More generally, it will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow better analysis of high-resolution fMRI data leading to better characterization of cortical function. For this project we choose to focus on studying memory activation in the medial temporal lobes using high-resolution imaging and multivariate analysis which could substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and major depression.

"Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ADHD is has long been believed to include brain-based pathophysiology, but the newest approaches to describing atypical brain organization in ADHD are just emerging and are thus far limited to cross-sectional studies. The present study has as its principal aims three objectives. First, it aims to characterize ADHD's brain organization longitudinally from childhood through adolescence, during a period of time in which ADHD youth enter very high risk for negative life outcomes, poor health outcomes, and comorbid behavioral, mood, and substance use disorders. In particular, the project aims to determine specified circuits, unique brain networks, and brain wide topological properties that relate to clinical course and outcome. Second, the proposal aims to bridge these developmental brain features with an enriched conception of phenotype, examining symptom domains, comorbidity, and measures of executive, reward, and emotional functioning in relation to specified brain metrics and targets. Third, it seeks to move the field forward in regard to clinica prediction by considering heterogeneity in two ways. One way is to examine novel typologies of ADHD based on differential brain organization across development. The other way is to utilize multiple methods to enhance prediction of clinical course. The significance of this effort lies bot in its unprecedented ability to characterize ADHD neurobiology over time with methods of brain characterization that have not been examined in ADHD longitudinally in this way before, and in its effort to move brain imaging into the realm of clinical prediction using a longitudinal design. The project is innovative in regard to implementing network and topology features of brain analysis in a multi-wave design, and tightly linking these to well defined, multi-level clinical course. The approach entails tracking of an already developed novel cohort of 376 children in a cross-lagged longitudinal design, enabling characterization of development from age 7-19 years. Brain organization will be operationalized with both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity. Youth will be characterized annually in relation to clinical symptoms, comorbidity, impairment, cognitive functioning, reward discounting, and emotion regulation and functioning. Analytic approaches will span brain circuit, network, and topological measurements using novel graph theoretical analyses to characterize brain systems. Clinical prediction will be undertaken using machine learning methodologies. Clinical typologies will be evaluated using both novel community detection procedures and more standard mixture model analysis of brain features. Finally, latent class trajectory models will be used to identify distint developmental types of ADHD if they exist. The prior grant period has been productive and this work builds on those findings to strengthen inference regarding the relation of brain organization to ADHD clinical features, course, and outcome. The Aims directly match key priorities of the NIMH strategic plan. If successful, the project hopes to break the impasse facing the field with regard to clinical utility of the growing grasp of atypical brain physiology in ADHD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much has been learned about brain correlates of ADHD, but this work has not yet affected clinical practice. The present project would characterize individual variation in ADHD brain development and attempt to use those findings to enhance clinical prediction. It thus aims to move the field closer to clinical application of brain imaging information of ADHD.",Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years,9208912,R56MH086654,"['pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' To specify ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' graph theory ', ' Developmental Course ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Conceptions ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incentives ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' ']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,769969,OR-03,-0.01093893397184837
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,PA-03,0.040844905556237765
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vector ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' neuropsychological ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' connectome ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,MI-12,-0.0007429672195829759
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction.

"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables. The lateral ventricles and corpus callosum are genetically correlated, and are often abnormal in schizophrenia, nonetheless, the genetic determinants of their relationship in schizophrenia remains unknown. Accordingly, we will employ the largest known population of schizophrenia and healthy subjects available, which includes morphometric, functional, cognitive and genetic data (2514 subjects), where we will analyze abnormalities of the lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum, and their relationship in schizophrenia. Volumetric and diffusion data will be explored for association with one of the strongest SZ associated genetic risk variant, MIR137, and with other genes, also SZ associated and themselves regulated by MIR137 and the outcome will be the identification of schizophrenia subgroups for more targeted intervention.","VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",9245247,R21MH109819,"['Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Corpus Callosums ', ' Corpus Callosum ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Syndrome ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' lateral ventricle ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Height ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Brain region ', ' genetic association ', ' Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 ', ' TCF7L2 ', ' TCF4 ', ' TCF-4 ', ' T-Cell-Specific Transcription Factor 4 ', ' TCF7L2 gene ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' trend ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' degenerative axon ', ' axon degeneration ', ' axonal degeneration ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' genetic information ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2016,240505,MA-07,0.007780201186824681

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.        ",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9102441,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,740993,PA-18,0.030432049436801663
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics.

"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9242756,R03MH109791,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brainstem ', ' Brain Stem ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mission ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Dissociation ', ' forest ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' myelination ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' proband ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' model development ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2016,76750,NJ-10,-0.009394795283751787
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9145621,K01AG051348,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Training ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Measurement ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Episodic memory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathological aging ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive system ', ' normal aging ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2016,131400,NY-13,0.001680817123445536
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9176279,R01MH107558,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Age ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Emotions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Logistics ', ' Collaborations ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' visual processing ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' Deltastab ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' phrases ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social cognition ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Predictive Value ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Social Functioning ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' visual process ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,574983,NY-13,0.0011430249716282883
"Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through ""part-of-speech"" tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (""which"", ""what"", ""that""). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subtle thought disorder is an early core feature of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset: it has traditionally been evaluated using clinical ratings or labor-intensive manual linguistic analyses. This proposal will apply novel computer-based speech analysis methods to existing datasets to identify abnormal semantic and syntactic features of language production that can predict or classify psychosis outcome among youths at clinical high risk for psychosis. Improved characterization of thought disorder can inform targeted preventive interventions for young people at risk for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, so as to reduce the morbidity of psychosis.            ",Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder.,9017082,R03MH108933,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Archives ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Friends ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' Deltastab ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' cognitive process ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2016,81000,NY-13,-0.09301728913972984
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9382777,R01MH112070,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Chronic Schizophrenia ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient population ', ' sharing data ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' individual patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,711253,PA-03,0.06904075897334813
"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for

"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms.

"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,PA-03,0.040844905556237765
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9479556,U01MH115727,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' California ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' Microglia ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Penetrance ', ' human data ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' protein expression ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' stem cell biology ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2017,4412707,MA-07,0.03138082531658251
"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables. The lateral ventricles and corpus callosum are genetically correlated, and are often abnormal in schizophrenia, nonetheless, the genetic determinants of their relationship in schizophrenia remains unknown. Accordingly, we will employ the largest known population of schizophrenia and healthy subjects available, which includes morphometric, functional, cognitive and genetic data (2514 subjects), where we will analyze abnormalities of the lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum, and their relationship in schizophrenia. Volumetric and diffusion data will be explored for association with one of the strongest SZ associated genetic risk variant, MIR137, and with other genes, also SZ associated and themselves regulated by MIR137 and the outcome will be the identification of schizophrenia subgroups for more targeted intervention.","VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",9357709,R21MH109819,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Corpus Callosums ', ' Corpus Callosum ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Syndrome ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' lateral ventricle ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Height ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Brain region ', ' genetic association ', ' TCF7L2 gene ', ' Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 ', ' TCF7L2 ', ' TCF4 ', ' TCF-4 ', ' T-Cell-Specific Transcription Factor 4 ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' trend ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' degenerative axon ', ' axon degeneration ', ' axonal degeneration ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' Impairment ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' genetic information ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' symptomatology ', ' tractography ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2017,190181,MA-07,0.007780201186824681
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders.

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life.

"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9394654,F31DA043328,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Fellowship ', ' Forensics ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' New Mexico ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' court ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' hazard ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' psychopathy ', ' psychopathic personality ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' independent component analysis ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' cognitive process ', ' symptomatology ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2017,31856,NM-01,-0.03098880444684446
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9327290,F31HD091967,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' Equation ', ' processing speed ', ' mathematical ability ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Learning disability ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Individual Differences ', ' brain behavior ', ' demographics ', ' reading ability ', ' reading proficiency ', ' reading competence ', ' reading achievement ', ' phonological awareness ', ' tractography ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2017,35797,CO-02,0.034306676404040885
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9251907,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' neural patterning ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,653164,PA-18,0.030432049436801663
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics. Our computational approaches and algorithms will help scientists analyze a wide range of neuroimaging and behavioral data, which will lead to the capability to discover therapeutic and pharmacological targets for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization,9360104,R01EB022911,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Publishing ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Collaborations ', ' Space Models ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' simulation ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' brain pathway ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' analytical tool ', ' Affective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' large scale simulation ', ' cognitive control ', ' network models ', ' information processing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' information model ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIBIB,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,393836,RI-01,0.005297126898458602
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brazil ', ' Cerebellum ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' pallidum ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' India ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Obsession ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' Inferior ', ' Performance ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' International Classification of Diseases ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ', ' response ', ' illness length ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' motor control ', ' compulsion ', ' Compulsive Behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' cognitive task ', ' treatment choice ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,NY-13,-0.030382178216154652
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.

"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9357677,R03MH109791,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brainstem ', ' Brain Stem ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Publishing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Dissociation ', ' forest ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' myelination ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' proband ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' model development ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Brain region ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' feeding ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' multimodality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2017,76750,NJ-10,-0.009394795283751787
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9331744,R01MH107558,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Emotions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Logistics ', ' Collaborations ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' visual processing ', ' Deltastab ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' phrases ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' deviant ', ' deviancy ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' social cognition ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Cognitive remediation ', ' language processing ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' EEG-based imaging ', ' EEG imaging ', ' auditory processing ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,193734,NY-13,0.0011430249716282883
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent.

"Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through ""part-of-speech"" tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (""which"", ""what"", ""that""). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subtle thought disorder is an early core feature of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset: it has traditionally been evaluated using clinical ratings or labor-intensive manual linguistic analyses. This proposal will apply novel computer-based speech analysis methods to existing datasets to identify abnormal semantic and syntactic features of language production that can predict or classify psychosis outcome among youths at clinical high risk for psychosis. Improved characterization of thought disorder can inform targeted preventive interventions for young people at risk for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, so as to reduce the morbidity of psychosis.",Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder.,9231498,R03MH108933,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Archives ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Friends ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Deltastab ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' cognitive process ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2017,35453,NY-13,-0.09301728913972984
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' myelination ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' theories ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Brain region ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' complex biological systems ', ' network architecture ', ' adolescent brain development ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' functional plasticity ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' phenotypic data ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,PA-03,0.07825059204262932
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9501776,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' mind control ', ' brain control ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vector ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' attentional control ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' connectome ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,483815,MI-12,-0.0007429672195829759
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9559419,F31HD091967,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' Equation ', ' processing speed ', ' mathematical ability ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Learning disability ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Individual Differences ', ' brain behavior ', ' demographics ', ' reading proficiency ', ' reading competence ', ' reading achievement ', ' reading ability ', ' phonological awareness ', ' tractography ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2018,36505,CO-02,0.034306676404040885
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9530687,K01MH111802,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Portraits ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' cortical mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortex mapping ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' individual patient ', ' connectome ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2018,186155,MA-08,0.07661540417854319
"Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The PI has recently shown that patterns of functional brain connectivity during wakeful rest can predict higher- order cognitive ability. The proposed retrospective analysis would both replicate this methodology within an independent healthy normative sample and extend this methodology to predict presurgical cognitive deficits among patients with refractory epilepsy. This project would also use machine learning algorithms to evaluate resting-state connectivity's ability to predict cognition relative to other MRI modalities, thus establishing the necessary framework for future work using resting-state brain activity to predicting postsurgical cognitive outcomes.",Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy,9528055,R03NS103000,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Cognition ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Handedness ', ' Laterality ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Standardization ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Lesion ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical effect ', ' parent grant ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical predictors ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' Structural defect ', ' cognitive ability ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic value ', ' language impairment ', ' tractography ', ' secondary analysis ', ' stroke model ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R03,2018,77820,AR-02,-0.0017119374764020955
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline.

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION PROJECT DESCRIPTION Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our proposal promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art “Connectome Skyra”, an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of “Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering”, which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain’s white matter tracts. Our proposal benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9521079,R01MH113800,"['Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Glutamates ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Protons ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Time ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Work ', ' Risperidone ', ' resperidone ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Dopaminergic Antagonists ', ' Dopamine Receptor Antagonists ', ' Dopamine Antagonists ', ' aripiprazole ', ' Abilify ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Predictive Value ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pathologic ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' therapy responders ', ' treatment responders ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,735068,AL-07,0.06268870455015543
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Early Intervention ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' gaze ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' energy balance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' actigraphy ', ' Symptoms ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' prospective ', ' Affective ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' longitudinal design ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' built environment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic data ', ' study population ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,MA-05,0.058668201782425974
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9484214,K01AG051348,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Training ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Measurement ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Episodic memory ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' pathological aging ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' analytical tool ', ' cognitive system ', ' normal aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2018,131400,NY-13,0.001680817123445536
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9583383,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' male ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Societies ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' critical period ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious ', ' Phobias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,109900,PA-03,0.02306064562350228
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9565939,F31DA043328,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Fellowship ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' New Mexico ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' court ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' hazard ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' psychopathy ', ' psychopathic personality ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' independent component analysis ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' cognitive process ', ' symptomatology ', ' predict relapse ', ' relapse prediction ', ' imaging study ', ' stimulant use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2018,27846,NM-01,-0.03098880444684446
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9577381,R01EB026549,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Emotions ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Charon ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' model development ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' population based ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussian model ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' translational impact ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,710896,MD-07,0.005331674128955889
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brazil ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' India ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Obsession ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' Inferior ', ' Performance ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' International Classification of Diseases ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ', ' response ', ' illness length ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' motor control ', ' compulsion ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' Structural defect ', ' cognitive task ', ' treatment choice ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,NY-13,-0.030382178216154652
"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9507688,F31NS103306,"['Age ', '

"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9428459,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' neural patterning ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' clinical imaging ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,643008,PA-18,0.030432049436801663
"ADNI Psychometrics: fcMRI and Machine Learning Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the structural data we are already analyzing, and adds analyses of functional data we had not previously been planning to analyze. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for Aim 2. The new functional data analyses incorporate measurements of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data from resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data collected by ADNI. Those data enable the characterization of functional connectivity. There are many levels of correlation in the analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data, and another talented faculty member in Radiology has specific expertise in analyzing these data (T Madhyastha). Dr. Madhyastha will supervise analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data from the cognitively-defined subgroups of Aim 2, which will provide important additional information regarding whether the functional connectivity patterns of people in these subgroups are similar to or different from each other. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672, ""ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups.

"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9591465,R24MH114806,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Capital ', ' Communities ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Environment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Validity of Results ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' animal data ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' high-end computing ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' investigator training ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' comparative ', ' brain research ', ' sharing data ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' cloud based ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' hackathon ', ' connectome ', ' software as a service ', ' human imaging ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2018,507643,NY-12,0.02754610208460821
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,PA-03,0.040844905556237765
"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,9647045,K01MH118477,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Boston ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' digital ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' patient population ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' bipolar patients ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' learning network ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' data access ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2018,137992,NY-13,0.040936316492981205
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brazil ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' India ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Siblings ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' morphometry ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Measurable ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' brain behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' cognitive task ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,NY-13,-0.038433841228579645
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9567622,R01MH112070,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Chronic Schizophrenia ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient population ', ' sharing data ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' individual patient ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,659674,PA-03,0.06904075897334813
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9507053,R21DA045969,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cocaine ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Heroin ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' indexing ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morphine ', ' Statex SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Oramorph ', ' Morphia ', ' MSir ', ' MS Contin ', ' Kadian ', ' Infumorph ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Oxycodone ', ' Roxicodone ', ' Oxycontin ', ' Oxycodone SR ', ' Oxycodeinon ', ' Dihydrohydroxycodeinone ', ' Perfusion ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Public Health ', ' putamen ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Spin Labels ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Parietal ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Heroin Users ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Lobule ', ' LBUL ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Brain region ', ' Dose ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Individual Differences ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' Abstinence ', ' reward processing ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' prescription opioid ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' connectome ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' opioid exposed ', ' opiate exposure ', ' opiate exposed ', ' opioid exposure ', ' prescription opiate misuse ', ' opioid prescription medication misuse ', ' opioid medication misuse ', ' opioid analgesic misuse ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opioids ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opiates ', ' non-medical use of prescription opioids ', ' non-medical use of prescription opiates ', ' prescription opioid misuse ', ' opiate misuse ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' opioid misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209375,CT-03,0.024611601685952743
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9522326,R01MH113550,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' indexing ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' prisma ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Fractals ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Wolves ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' data resource ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,798446,PA-03,0.07049692267784594
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction. Although fMRI studies of brain function have primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of perceptual or cognitive tasks, there is growing consensus that cognitive functions emerge as a result of dynamic context-dependent interactions between multiple brain areas. Developing new computational methods for investigating causal interactions in fMRI data has therefore taken added significance; the overall goal of this proposal is to address this critical need by developing new methods for studying causal interactions and brain connectivity between distributed brain regions during cognition.",Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction,9521866,R01NS086085,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Parietal ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo technique ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo method ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo computational algorithm ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Computational Science ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' optogenetics ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive burden ', ' cognitive load ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' connectome ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,554411,CA-18,-0.07591082748342871
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9481191,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Logistics ', ' Collaborations ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' visual processing ', ' Deltastab ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' phrases ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' deviant ', ' deviancy ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' social cognition ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Cognitive remediation ', ' language processing ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' EEG imaging ', ' EEG-based imaging ', ' auditory processing ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,616434,NY-13,0.0011430249716282883
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for

"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9747296,R01EB026549,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Emotions ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Charon ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' model development ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' population based ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' translational impact ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,692050,MD-07,0.005331674128955889
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9766371,R24MH114806,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Capital ', ' Communities ', ' Comparative Study ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Design ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Validity of Results ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' animal data ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' high-end computing ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' investigator training ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' comparative ', ' brain research ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cloud based ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' hackathon ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' connectome ', ' software as a service ', ' human imaging ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2019,545648,NY-12,0.02754610208460821
"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for risk stratification. This study will analyze ""big data"" from electronic health records linked to genetic data to evaluate the prediction of clinical outcomes using PRSs and social determinants of health.","2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",9876282,R01MH121924,"['suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' ']",NIMH,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,404655,MN-01,0.017057031699964583
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods.

"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Linear Models ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' neural correlate ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Developmental Course ', ' personalized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,CT-03,0.013920685787879977
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9644557,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' neural patterning ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' clinical imaging ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,638179,PA-18,0.030432049436801663
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9755521,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' gaze ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' energy balance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Symptoms ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' prospective ', ' Affective ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' longitudinal design ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' built environment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic data ', ' study population ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,740241,MA-05,0.058668201782425974
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments.

"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for risk stratification. This study will analyze ""big data"" from electronic health records linked to genetic data to evaluate the prediction of clinical outcomes using PRSs and social determinants of health.","4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",9877153,R01MH121922,"['Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,408726,NY-12,0.017057031699964583
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.

"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology.

"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Measures ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Undifferentiated ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' large scale simulation ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' social learning ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,CA-27,0.021840564950265567
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),9699782,P50MH115846,"['Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' North America ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Science ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Discipline ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' effectiveness research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' faculty community ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2019,1467963,MA-05,0.01853265345187098
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Adolescent Medicine ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Medical center ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' outpatient programs ', ' outpatient services ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,MA-08,0.047896584962452145
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9693300,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Emotions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Logistics ', ' Collaborations ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' visual processing ', ' Deltastab ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' phrases ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' deviant ', ' deviancy ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' social cognition ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Cognitive remediation ', ' language processing ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' EEG-based imaging ', ' EEG imaging ', ' auditory processing ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,676659,NY-13,0.0011430249716282883
"Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The PI has recently shown that patterns of functional brain connectivity during wakeful rest can predict higher- order cognitive ability. The proposed retrospective analysis would both replicate this methodology within an independent healthy normative sample and extend this methodology to predict presurgical cognitive deficits among patients with refractory epilepsy. This project would also use machine learning algorithms to evaluate resting-state connectivity's ability to predict cognition relative to other MRI modalities, thus establishing the necessary framework for future work using resting-state brain activity to predicting postsurgical cognitive outcomes.",Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy,9640497,R03NS103000,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Cognition ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diffusion ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Laterality ', ' Handedness ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Standardization ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Lesion ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical effect ', ' parent grant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical predictors ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' language impairment ', ' tractography ', ' secondary analysis ', ' stroke model ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R03,2019,77920,AR-02,-0.0017119374764020955
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9723205,K01MH111802,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Portraits ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' individual patient ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,186155,MA-08,0.07661540417854319
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  The goal of the parent grant is to delineate abnormalities in the development of structural and functional brain networks associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders including attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the psychosis spectrum (PS). However, critical aspects of executive dysfunction remain unexplored. First, sex differences in executive function are substantial, and disorders with prominent executive dysfunction (such ADHD and psychosis) are more prevalent in males. Notably, the aims of the parent grant only proposed to examine executive dysfunction across males and females, and did not propose to examine how sex-specific network abnormalities relate to sex differences in executive function. Second, the parent grant focuses on the broad construct of executive function, which is composed of multiple specific cognitive domains including working memory, performance monitoring, set shifting, inhibition, and sustained attention. At present, the aims of the parent grant do not propose to identify specific links between brain networks and these component processes. In this supplement, we will fill these important gaps in the parent grant using advanced tools from network science and machine learning. To do this, we will capitalize upon an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of irritability in youth that provides highly relevant data and is nearly complete (n=200). Findings in this valuable dataset will be replicated in the parent grant as data accrues. Together, this supplement will provide novel insights regarding the network-level substrates of executive dysfunction and provide the candidate with a superb training experience in computational psychiatry. This training will position him to succeed in a top neuroscience graduate program. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. A greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. These novel clinical interventions would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9841623,R01MH113550,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychiatry ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' parent grant ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' sustained attention ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,84344,PA-03,0.04113711272542696
"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,9786244,K01MH118477,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Boston ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Mobility ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Sociology ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' early onset ', ' digital ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' patient population ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' bipolar patients ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' data access ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2019,141124,NY-13,0.040936316492981205
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' gaze ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' energy balance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Symptoms ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' prospective ', ' Affective ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' longitudinal design ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' built environment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic data ', ' study population ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,173908,MA-05,0.058668201782425974
"3/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health factors, such as employment and educational attainment, can increase the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data.

"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),10001157,P50MH115846,"['website ', ' effectiveness research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' faculty community ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' North America ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Science ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Discipline ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' web site ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2019,320161,MA-05,0.01853265345187098
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9757833,U01MH115727,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' California ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Microglia ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Penetrance ', ' human data ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' protein expression ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' stem cell biology ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' Data Science ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2019,4129117,MA-07,0.03138082531658251
"Neural Correlates of Familial and Non-familial ADHD SUMMARY Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent and heritable neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuroimaging studies have found that ADHD is associated with decreased volume of cortical and subcortical structures, delayed posterior to anterior cortical maturation, and dysfunction of fronto-striatal and thalamo- cortical networks. However, findings from these existing studies are highly inconsistent in terms of the structural and functional abnormality patterns. Beyond possible demographic and developmental factors, etiological heterogeneity of the disorder can be a significant component that contributes to the inconsistence of these findings. Among the complicated biological and environmental elements, familial heredity is the most significant factor for the emergence of ADHD. Relative to that in non-familial ADHD (ADHD-n), familial ADHD (ADHD-f) showed more severe executive dysfunction and much higher rate for persisting ADHD symptoms into adulthood. These findings suggest that ADHD-f may represent a biologically more homogeneous subgroup. However, neural substrates of familial vs. non-familial ADHD have not yet been well investigated. By utilizing advanced neuroimaging and analytic techniques, this research will assess the [parental history- related] familial risk influences on functional and structural brain organizations in children with ADHD. Two groups of ADHD (ADHD-f and ADHD-n)) and group-matched control children (TDC) will be involved. Based on extensive findings from existing neuroimaging and clinical studies conducted in our group and other groups, our general hypothesis is that compared to the TDC, both ADHD groups will show significant functional and structural alterations in frontal lobe and thalamus; while relative to ADHD-n, the ADHD-f group will show more severe functional and structural aberrance in frontal lobe and related circuitry. Our ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neurobiological correlates of the risk factors into clinically applicable biomarkers for guiding individualized interventions in ADHD. The findings of this research represent an important first step in the development of novel and refined intervention strategies for biologically homogeneous subgroups of ADHD. [This project will significantly enhance the research infrastructure and student education at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), by providing biomedical and behavioral science-related training and research experiences to undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented minorities and females. This would allow them to acquire a broad spectrum of fundamental and advanced knowledge and skills in all clinical and technical aspects involved in human subject clinical and neuroimaging research, and develop a vast network of collaborations through the active biomedical and clinical scientists involved in this project. This AREA project thus has significant positive impact on academics and research at NJIT.] NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent in the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan.

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9742524,R01MH112070,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Chronic Schizophrenia ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient population ', ' data sharing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' individual patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,659674,PA-03,0.06904075897334813
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,9691831,R01AG054628,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' mortality ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' network architecture ', ' cognitive performance ', ' genetic predictors ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' connectome ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,470535,TX-10,-0.021960080261752887
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging

"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced

"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,9909889,F31NS115348,"['Adoption ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Florida ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Noise ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' progression marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' learning community ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' tractography ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2019,34014,TX-30,-0.08362143391092798
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large.",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9985283,R00MH117274,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' male ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' critical period ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxious ', ' Phobias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,TN-05,0.02306064562350228
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9894275,R24MH114806,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Capital ', ' Communities ', ' Comparative Study ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Design ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Validity of Results ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' animal data ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' high-end computing ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' investigator training ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' comparative ', ' brain research ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cloud based ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' hackathon ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' connectome ', ' software as a service ', ' human imaging ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2019,23100,NY-12,0.02754610208460821
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning

"Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache ABSTRACT There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH) during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH. Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH. R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g. demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.   Project Narrative: Currently, there are no adequate methods to predict whether an individual with post-traumatic headache (PTH) will have resolution of headaches during the acute phase or will have persistence of PTH (PPTH). The goal of this study is to identify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data and structural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predict who will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acute phase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who are likely to have PTH persistence.  ",Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache,9829475,R61NS113315,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Headache ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posttraumatic Headaches ', ' Post-Traumatic Headaches ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' non-opioid analgesic ', ' nonopioid ', ' nonopiate analgesic ', ' non-opioid ', ' non-opiate analgesic ', ' non-narcotic analgesic ', ' Nonopioid Analgesics ', ' Nonnarcotic Analgesics ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Population ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' biomarker development ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' common symptom ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R61,2019,3152333,AZ-06,0.0032054568317286206
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9827207,R21MH120789,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Illusions ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Patients ', ' Personality Disorders ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Distance ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' social space ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' vector ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' virtual ', ' Social Functioning ', ' social neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' volunteer ', ' patient population ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' clinical predictors ', ' social anxiety ', ' social learning ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' social defeat ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2019,254250,NY-13,0.013161746284640471
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9705932,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' male ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' critical period ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxious ', ' Phobias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,11937,PA-03,0.02306064562350228
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9710707,R01MH115000,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Institutes ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Philadelphia ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Work ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Genetic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Sensory ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Neurocognition ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' cognitive ability ', ' neural correlate ', ' improved outcome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,369864,TN-05,0.07601935197153023
"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', '

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,10001025,R01MH120482,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Maps ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Properdin ', ' Complement Factor P ', ' factor P ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Societies ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' quality assurance ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' synergism ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Sum ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' somatosensory ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' anxious ', ' Data Analytics ', ' data library ', ' data archive ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' data resource ', ' imaging study ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' serial imaging ', ' Grain ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Data Pooling ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,724789,PA-03,0.026498234760040835
"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Crowding ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neonate ', ' feeding ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Problem ', ' Outcome ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' connectome ', ' Risk stratification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification algorithm ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,534605,OH-01,-0.019556495363565893
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"Integrating neuroimaging and brain gene expression for functional characterization of psychiatric GWAS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mental disorders are complex, debilitating health conditions, yet the neurobiological causes and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. The emergence of large- scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enabled identification of significant, reliable genetic associations to mental disorders. However, it has been difficult to translate GWAS loci into specific causal driver variants/genes to extract mechanistic insights for identifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. Neurobiological intermediate phenotypes (NBIPs) are invaluable in understanding the brain’s structural and functional correlates of elevated risk of psychopathology, although the underlying processes and molecular mechanisms for observed NBIPs are elusive. Recent advances in genetic-based imputation now allow one to infer genetically-regulated portions of intermediate phenotypes from genome-wide genotype data. Our research team has successfully employed brain-specific transcriptomic imputation approaches across mental disorders to identify novel genes and pathways of risk. In this proposal, we seek to increase the biological resolution of the link between neuroimaging genetics and psychiatric genetics by creating novel polygenic models of multimodal neuroimaging based on brain-specific gene expression that can be applied to psychiatric GWAS. In Aim 1, we will generate brain transcriptomic predictive models of multimodal neuroimaging and replicate them in independent datasets. In Aim 2, we will conduct Imaging Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (ITWAS) to identify neuroimaging associations with mental disorders at a brain-specific gene-level and distinguish the causal ones. Our integrative analyses will enhance our understanding of NBIPs and mental disorder risk; thus, they will provide mechanistic insights that may drive identification of novel diagnostic, trans-diagnostic and treatment approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental disorders have substantial morbidity and mortality, contributing to devastating emotional, social and financial tolls on sufferers and their families.

"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,9994406,K01MH118477,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Boston ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' digital ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' patient population ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' bipolar patients ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' associate faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' learning network ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' Data Science ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' data access ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' high dimensionality ', ' data streams ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,137992,NY-13,0.040936316492981205
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9873081,R01MH113550,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' indexing ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' prisma ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Fractals ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Wolves ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' data resource ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,734680,PA-03,0.07049692267784594
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' pediatric anxiety ', ' youth anxiety ', ' childhood anxiety ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' person centered ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' individual patient ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' burden on families ', ' burden to families ', ' familial burden ', ' family burden ', ' ']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,PA-02,-0.03258458594861164
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging

"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for risk stratification. This study will analyze ""big data"" from electronic health records linked to genetic data to evaluate the prediction of clinical outcomes using PRSs and social determinants of health.","4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",10007905,R01MH121922,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' structured data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,408726,NY-12,0.017057031699964583
"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9709107,R01HD092331,"['Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' New Mexico ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Sociology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' habitual offender ', ' multiple offender ', ' repeat offender ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' correctional system ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Academia ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Pathologic ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' convict ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' high dimensionality ', ' protective factors ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' social factors ', ' structured data ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Crime ', ' Criminology ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Firearms ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' ']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,706182,NM-01,-0.012143382147771683
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),9928111,P50MH115846,"['Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' North America ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Discipline ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' faculty community ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2020,1704908,MA-05,0.01853265345187098
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness. Simultaneously, this proposal will develop the career of the Principal Investigator, Miklos Argyelan, M.D., as an independent translational researcher.",Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9989904,U01MH115727,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' California ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Hortega cell ', ' gitter cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' microglial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' Microglia ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Scientist ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Test Result ', ' Penetrance ', ' human data ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' protein expression ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' analytical tool ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' stem cell biology ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' Data Science ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' ']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2020,4125261,MA-07,0.03138082531658251
"Refining and Validating Borderline Personality Disorder Phenotypes Through Factor Mixture Modeling The proposed research seeks to clarify the symptomatic heterogeneity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) by examining BPD phenotypes through advanced latent variable modeling. A second, innovative aim is to validate these findings through intensive longitudinal assessment in daily life. BPD is associated with high rates of emergency room visits and costly healthcare service utilization, affecting 10-20% of psychiatric outpatients and 20-40% of psychiatric inpatients. BPD also contributes to impaired social and occupational functioning and significant suicide risk, with 1 in 10 individuals with BPD completing suicide. Recent research has aimed to enhance treatment effectiveness for BPD by identifying prototypical patterns of symptom manifestation that may suggest ideographic treatment targets. However, no research has simultaneously included: a) a sufficiently large patient sample; b) ecologically sound validation of results; and c) use of appropriate statistical techniques. The proposed project builds on this research through two aims. Aim 1: Utilize a model comparison approach to identify BPD phenotypes in a large psychiatric outpatient sample assessed via semi-structured diagnostic interviews (Study 1). Aim 2: Validate the results of Study 1 by applying phenotype classification algorithms produced in Study 1 to a smaller sample of patients who have completed 21 days of momentary surveys on symptoms and clinical outcomes (Study 2). To address Aim 1, factor mixture modeling (FMM)—a novel, flexible, and integrative latent variable modeling approach—will be compared to standard factor analysis and latent class analysis in order to evaluate the dimensional and categorical structure of BPD. We expect a single-factor, multi-class FMM will best explain heterogeneity in BPD, over and above other sources of heterogeneity (e.g., gender, comorbidity). To address Aim 2, we will use a prototype-matching approach to algorithmically assign patients in the validation sample to phenotypes identified in Aim 1 and determine their predictive validity in terms of daily clinical outcomes. Results of this project will provide empirically grounded personalized prediction tools for BPD intervention and treatment development, in line with the NIMH’s goal of “developing, testing, and refining tools and methodologies… for personalized risk and trajectory prediction and intervention.” This fellowship will allow the applicant to receive tailored consultation from experts in methodology, data analysis, and BPD theory and assessment, as well as advanced statistical training and grantsmanship courses and workshops. This training will be enhanced by the resource-rich environment and explicit support of student research and funding provided by the Pennsylvania State University, as well as the support of Dr. Kenneth Levy and his lab. This promising young researcher will gain training in computational modeling, proficiency in working with “big data,” increased understanding of conceptual and nosological models of BPD, and further skills in disseminating research findings through publication and presentation, as vital steps towards an independent research career in translational clinical science. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to elucidate the underlying psychopathology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a prevalent, costly, and deadly psychiatric condition, through the identification of ecologically valid phenotypes of the disorder. Accurate identification of BPD phenotypes promises to reveal patterns of symptoms that can be targeted in treatment development, improving treatment effectiveness for this impairing disorder.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9920211,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' male ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' data quality ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Genomics ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' cognitive performance ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' genomic variation ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' symptom cluster ', ' Internet of Things ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,709525,PA-03,0.020435102683789803
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition.

"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9908089,R01EB026549,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Emotions ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Charon ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' model development ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' population based ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussian model ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' translational impact ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,667005,MD-07,0.005331674128955889
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of R01MH074457-13, which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data. To date, the BrainMap Project has designed and populated two coordinate-based databases: 1) a task-activation repository (TA DB); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry repository (VBM DB). The TA DB contains >17,200 experiments, collectively representing > 78,000 subjects and > 110 task- activation paradigms. The VBM DB contains > 3,100 experiments, collectively representing > 81,000 subjects with > 80 psychiatric, neurologic and developmental disorders with ICD-10 coding. The BrainMap Project has created, optimized and validated an integrated pipeline of multi-platform (Javascript), open-access tools to curate (Scribe), filter and retrieve (Sleuth), analyze (GingerALE), visualize (Mango) and interpret analysis output (BrainMap meta-data plugins for Mango). Several network-modeling approaches have been applied to BrainMap data -- MACM, independent components analysis (ICA), graph theory modeling (GTM), author-topic modeling (ATM), structural equation modeling (SEM), and connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) – but none are yet pipeline components. Utilization of these CBMA resources is substantial: BrainMap software, data and meta-data have been used in > 825 peer-reviewed publications. Of these, > 350 were published within the current funding period (April 2015-March 2019; brainmap.org/pubs). In this competing renewal, four tool- development aims are proposed, each of which extends this high-impact research resource. Aim 1. Database Expansion. BrainMap data repositories will be expanded. Aim 2. Meta-analytic Network Modeling. Network modeling will be added to the BrainMap pipeline. Aim 3. Large-Scale Simulations, Comparisons and Validations. Data simulations, characterizations and validations will be performed. Aim 4. Meta-data Inferential tools. Tools for mining BrainMap’s location-linked meta-data will be expanded. Data Sharing Plan. BrainMap data, meta-data, pipeline tools, and templates created by whole-database modeling (e.g., ICA and ATM network masks) are shared at BrainMap.org. Of all new data entries, more than half are contributed by BrainMap users, i.e., community data sharing via BrainMap.org.

"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and

"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,10019347,F31NS115348,"['Adoption ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Florida ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Noise ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' progression biomarker ', ' progression marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' learning community ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' tractography ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34768,TX-30,-0.08362143391092798
"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for risk stratification. This study will analyze ""big data"" from electronic health records linked to genetic data to evaluate the prediction of clinical outcomes using PRSs and social determinants of health.","2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",10007908,R01MH121924,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' structured data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,404741,MN-01,0.017057031699964583
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Measures ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Undifferentiated ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' large scale simulation ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' social learning ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,CA-27,0.021840564950265567
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9995592,R21MH120789,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Illusions ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Patients ', ' Personality Disorders ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' No hope for the future ', ' hopelessness ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' social space ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' vector ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' virtual ', ' Social Functioning ', ' social neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' volunteer ', ' patient population ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' clinical predictors ', ' social anxiety ', ' social learning ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' social defeat ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' social relationships ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,211875,NY-13,0.013161746284640471
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning

"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' neural correlate ', ' Developmental Course ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,CT-03,0.013920685787879977
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not.

"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10058921,R01MH124106,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Measures ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' 11 years of age ', ' age 11 years ', ' eleven year old ', ' eleven years of age ', ' 11 year old ', ' analytical tool ', ' cognitive control ', ' network models ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' cognitive development ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussian model ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Science ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' biological sex ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,710101,NY-13,0.00926292752781043
"1/4 Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health factors, such as employment and educational attainment, can increase the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will generate new data in improving our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative measures of genetic risk (polygenic risk scores) for risk stratification. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques for development of PRSs and their association to clinical outcomes and social determinants using large-scale integrated phenotype-genotype data.","1/4 Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",10015337,R01MH121921,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' technique development ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' structured data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,264857,NY-13,0.016731890927433348
"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9980111,R01MH120091,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' functional decline ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,317000,PA-02,0.08171328896775253

This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will generate new data in improving our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative measures of genetic risk (polygenic risk scores) for risk stratification. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques for development of PRSs and their association to clinical outcomes and social determinants using large-scale integrated phenotype-genotype data.","3/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",10007906,R01MH121923,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' technique development ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' structured data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,429337,NY-13,0.016731890927433348
"Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states Project Summary: Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain encodes behavior presents a major challenge for developing effective therapies with which to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of brain-wide measurements of neural connectivity in mammalian models holds great potential for overcoming this challenge. Here we propose an innovative approach for collecting and integrating such data across an unprecedented number of interconnected brain regions for use in elucidating the mechanisms by which sensory processing is altered in disease. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders are triggered or exacerbated by sensory stimuli, yet little is understood about the brain connectivity underlying such sensory hyper/hypo- sensitization. Sensory processing plays a major role in the pathology of: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sensory perception disorders (SPDs), and migraine. Migraine in particular represents a compelling model of sensory hypersensitization, as the response to sensory stimuli is clear, dose- dependent, and measurable. Using state-of-the-art, multi-site in vivo recordings in a well- characterized migraine model, coupled with machine learning, we will develop network-wide electrical maps of the sensory hypersensitivity that underlies migraine. These networks will be validated for their roles in migraine using multiple behavioral assays and migraine-related pharmacological manipulations. We will additionally dissect the mechanisms underlying the sensory hypersensitivity brain state in a mouse model of migraine using optogenetic circuit manipulations as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, with the aim of identifying the contributions of specific circuits, cells, and molecules to this state. This approach is expected to substantially facilitate the use of neural oscillation-based brain networks in biomedical research, as well as provide: 1) a tool for rapid identification of a sensory hypersensitive brain state that can be tested for mechanisms shared across disorders, 2) a map of features of electrical brain networks, which serve as strong hypotheses regarding the routes whereby sensory hypersensitivity brain networks are regulated, and 3) insight into the contributions of specific cell types and molecules to the hypersensitive brain state. Collectively, this study is expected to provide insights into the etiology of migraine and other sensory hypersensitivity disorders that will be critical to developing brain network-based therapies for these diseases. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This proposal seeks to harness a powerful approach for mapping electrical activity across the brain and to use this information to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity, a key aspect of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data collected from this study will provide a comprehensive map of electrical activity in sensory hypersensitivity in a preclinical migraine model; migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the general population. These maps will then be used to identify novel brain-network based targets for the development of new therapeutics, establishing a unique approach that could be applied broadly to many brain disorders for which effective therapies remain elusive.",Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states,10001808,DP2MH126377,"['Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Maps ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Perceptual Disorders ', ' perception disorder ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' Migraine ', ' Hyposensitization Therapy ', ' Immunologic Desensitization ', ' hyposensitization ', ' hypersensitivity desensitization ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Route ', ' cell type ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Dose ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' in vivo ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Network-based ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' optogenetics ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,DP2,2020,2317500,IA-02,-0.024520207188398813
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project.

"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large.",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9994407,R00MH117274,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' male ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' critical period ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious ', ' Phobias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,243129,TN-05,0.02306064562350228
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis). Changes in frontal-temporal regions/circuitry and neurocognitive measures over time will be examined together using novel approaches (e.g., machine learning) to predict diagnostic group, symptom severity, and functional outcome for the identification of key factors associated with risk and resilience in the SZ spectrum.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,9985547,R01MH121411,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Patients ', ' Personality Disorders ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Schizotypal Personality Disorder ', ' schizotypal ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', "" Brodmann's area "", ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' early onset ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' Neurocognition ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' longitudinal design ', ' longitudinal course ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' protective factors ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,839437,NY-13,0.057457933213794846
"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9983971,R01MH120092,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' functional decline ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,401699,GA-10,0.08103543283016816
"Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data which have been acquired with varying amounts of technical harmonization. Such efforts, which have focused on protocol harmonization and comparisons with imaging phantoms, have shown great strides toward reducing inter- scanner differences in imaging features extracted for further study. Unfortunately, MRI show inter-instrument biases even in the most carefully controlled studies. Our group, among many others, has shown that these differences often dwarf biological differences of interest measured using both structural and functional MRI.  To address this, the field has rapidly been developing tools for the harmonization of imaging data after acquisition. We have proposed several such tools, and our work has often focused on the adaptation of methods used in genomic studies for batch effect correction. Our most recent such work involved the ComBat method, which uses empirical Bayesian estimation to correct for site effects in both means and variances of imaging features under study. To date, these tools have been successfully applied in studies of cortical thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. However, there are unfortunately several key limitations to the ComBat method for imaging studies that stem from its original conception for gene expression studies.  ComBat was designed for the study of inter-scanner differences in cross-sectionally acquired data. While cross-sectional studies are of great interest and exceedingly common, much focus in the context of healthy brain development and aging has shifted to measuring longitudinal trajectories. In such cases, the naïve application of ComBat is flawed and methodological research is necessary for appropriate harmonization tools to be developed. Furthermore, more complex nested study design in which multiple scanners are used per institution, or a subset of subjects are imaged on multiple scanners for harmonization purposes, are increasingly common. Another key area of interest in modern neuroimaging studies is to focus on inter-region structural or functional connectivity and uses multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to improve our understanding of phenotypic associations as well as for personalized predictions. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art in image harmonization ignores correlation structure between measurements, and thus inter- scanner differences often persist.  In this project, we propose a new generation of techniques that are applicable under complex study designs and harmonize appropriately for studies involving applications of MVPA. In our final aim of this proposal, we will apply the methods developed for more complex study designs and MVPA in the context of two of the largest NIH-funded multi-center consortia across the lifespan.

"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary

"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9920230,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Logistics ', ' Collaborations ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' visual processing ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Balpred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Diopred ', ' Econopred ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Predaject ', ' Predalone ', ' Predate ', ' Predcor ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predni-H ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predniocil ', ' Deltastab ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' phrases ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' social cognition ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Cognitive remediation ', ' language processing ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' auditory processing ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,676651,NY-13,0.0011430249716282883
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9872025,F30MH118871,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' DiGeorge Syndrome ', ' 22q11 Chromosomal Microdeletion Syndrome ', ' 22q11 Deletion Syndrome ', ' 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ', ' 22q11.2DS ', ' 22q11DS ', ' Autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome ', ' Cayler cardiofacial syndrome ', ' Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ', ' Di George syndrome ', ' DiGeorge anomaly ', ' DiGeorge sequence ', ' branchial arch syndrome ', ' conotruncal anomaly face syndrome ', ' familial third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syndrome ', ' pharyngeal pouch syndrome ', ' third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syndrome ', ' thymic and parathyroid agenesis syndrome ', ' thymic aplasia syndrome ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' selective attention ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Occupational ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' regional difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Property ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' 22q11.2 ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupling ', ' cognitive control ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' learning network ', ' Self-Direction ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' symptomatology ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,PA-03,0.06484502336451776
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Manias ', ' Manic State ', ' Manic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' gaze ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' energy balance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Symptoms ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' prospective ', ' Affective ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' longitudinal design ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' built environment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic data ', ' study population ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,MA-05,0.058668201782425974
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9890000,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' neural patterning ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' associated symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' protective factors ', ' pre-clinical imaging ', ' preclinical imaging ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,620389,PA-18,0.030432049436801663
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data

"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Foundations ', ' indexing ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Intercept ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' Child Behavioral Checklist ', ' Childhood Behavior Checklist ', ' Children Behavior Checklist ', ' Child Behavior Checklist ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Reproducibility ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' critical period ', ' effective intervention ', ' standardize measure ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' cognitive development ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' machine learning method ', ' psychiatric genomics ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,MA-08,-0.0024857591332068368
"Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations PROJECT SUMMARY Network analysis of brain connectivity, or Connectomics, has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, making strides in advancing both fundamental scientific knowledge on the structure of the brain, as well as providing insights into the pathology of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging technologies have enabled acquisition of high-resolution datasets on brain activities in normal and diseased populations, while advanced machine learning methods hold promise to obtain data-driven insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Functional connectivity analysis is typically carried out in two steps. First, one estimates a network among different brain regions by studying strengths of associations among the time course of neurophysiological signals for different subjects (patients or healthy controls). Next, one compares the networks between different groups of subjects and seeks network features prevalent in specific groups of interest using statistical methods. Two emerging challenges in this field are the presence of heterogeneity amongst subjects in large study cohorts, and developing predictive models to construct robust and interpretable results. The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning methods equipped with uncertainty quantification measures, suitable for high-dimensional network data for heterogeneous populations. Upon completion, these methods are expected to provide automated, robust and more accurate discovery of connectivity patterns that is prevalent in heterogeneous populations of patients. We aim to accomplish this goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop estimation and inference methods for frequency domain measures of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks, (2) develop a framework of mixed effects model of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks that accounts for heterogeneity among subjects and enables discoveries more likely to generalize in large cohorts. For each aim, novel machine learning methods for integrative analysis of structural and functional connectivity will be developed using a mathematical model of network diffusion. We will also calibrate and validate our proposed methods on data from Human Connectome Project, and on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The proposed approach is innovative since it integrates machinery across diverse disciplines, including statistics, machine learning and network analysis to address important challenges learning large functional connectivity graphs. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have both scientific and translational impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding brain connectivity patterns using rigorous machine learning methods can help seek common patterns in large databases in an automated fashion, and can potentially lead to development of neuroimaging based diagnostic tools and sensitive prognostic measures.

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9942277,R01MH112070,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Chronic Schizophrenia ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient population ', ' data sharing ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,658144,PA-03,0.06904075897334813
"Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in discovery of genetic variants and genes associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. Altered gene expression in the brain, particularly at the cell-type-specific level, is believed to be a driving factor in conferring risk through these genetic variants. To link altered transcription to psychopathology, an immense amount of transcriptomic data is being accumulated, including single-cell and tissue level transcriptomes. Some of these samples cover critical developmental periods. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate single cell and tissue level transcriptomic data and how genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells to produce psychopathology. In this high dimensional ‘omics setting, we need powerful statistical and machine learning tools to produce integrative analyses and mesh those results with large psychiatric genetic datasets to achieve new insights. We propose to use our expertise in high dimensional statistical inference to tackle this challenge. We go beyond machine learning models that specialize in prediction, focusing instead on providing interpretable statistical inferences. We identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, driving risk. With vast amounts of data comes great risk of spurious inferences based on non-rigorous analyses. On the other hand, reliable, but naïve tools can sacrifice power by not fully integrating all available information. Our overall objective to produce analytic tools that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating cell-type-specific gene expression with genetic risk factors. With these analytical tools made available to the research community, our longer-term goal is to hasten discoveries in the field and thus build the foundation from which therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders emerge. Our objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific aims: 1) statistically rigorous methods to select cell-type markers and to estimate cell-type-specific (CTS) expression, which will facilitate downstream analyses, including CTS eQTLs from tissue; 2) modeling dynamic gene communities throughout development of cell lineages or tissue and relating them to community-based-score statistics to gain insight into the impact of genetic risk factors on psychiatric disorders; and 3) novel methods for estimating gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA-seq. This contribution is significant because it will make many transcriptomic resources more valuable and enable downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS eQTLs in larger sample sets with higher power. Dynamic network analysis tools enhance our ability to identify gene communities that vary over developmental epochs and this variation facilitates inferences that relate cell type and developmental period with risk factors. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, and cutting edge results to represent high dimensional data in a meaningful way that lends itself to clustering and network analysis. The statistical tools and results arising from the proposed research are relevant to public health because they will generate a deeper understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9893033,R01MH115000,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Institutes ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Sensory ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Neurocognition ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' cognitive ability ', ' neural correlate ', ' improved outcome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,392508,TN-05,0.07601935197153023
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.
