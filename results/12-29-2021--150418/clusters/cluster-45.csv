"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           ",Translational Studies of FASD

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          ",Mouse Model

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.

"Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse Project Summary/Abstract. Drugs of abuse are metabolized by the cells of the body including macrophages and leukocytes. Macrophages are primarily responsible for the detection, phagocytosis and digestion of toxins in the bloodstream and peripheral tissues. Normal cellular metabolism of macrophages and other cells are permanently affected by the presence of toxins in the blood which may include illicit substances such as cocaine and alcohol. We propose to study macrophages and other blood cells from normal and cocaine addicted rats and mice in automated, high-throughput biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS) coupled to ion mobility mass spectrometers and obtain comprehensive measurements of metabolic precursors, products and signaling molecules in real time. We will analyze the wide-spectrum of temporally varying biochemical signature of the living cells before and during exposure to precise doses of cocaine and alcohol administered to cells in the traps using automatic inference of mathematical models. We hypothesize that the resulting metabolic models and biochemical signatures from the cells of addicted animals and normal animals will differ significantly due to permanent alterations in cell physiology brought about by prior exposure. Passive observations and those made during simple interventions can tell much about the response of the cells to a drug or toxin, but the specification of many of the interlocking and nonlinear control systems of individual cells is hidden by the very nature of closed-loop control and requires experiments that measure very large numbers of variables. The automated inference presents daunting challenges that cannot be addressed by a single discipline and hence signifies an exciting frontier for interdisciplinary research. A group of biomedical, chemical and computer engineers, chem- ists, molecular biologists and physicists at Vanderbilt, Cornell, Duke and CFD Research Corporation, propose to merge their talents and optimize computer-controlled nanoliter bioreactors that would use optical, electrical, and electrochemical sensors, two-dimensional mass spectrometry, and novel computer algorithms to design and conduct experiments on small populations of living cells. The goal of this work is to automatically infer the underlying nonlinear dynamical equations governing the behavior of the cells and their environment in the presence and absence of cocaine and alcohol. We will address this challenge by applying Cornell's Symbolic Regression and Exploration-Estimation Algorithms that use in silico coevolution of both the model and tests of the model to experimentally determine which conditions are best suited for further evolution. Our suite of micro- fabricated BioMEMS nanobioreactors, dynamic sensors, and cellular control technologies ensures that we will have adequate dynamical data to create sophisticated metabolic and signaling models of macrophages and leukocytes. This research will have a unique and remarkable educational, intellectual, medical and societal value. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will impact public health by more accurately characterizing drug abuse and the history of drug abuse in individuals so as to tailor methods of intervention and treatment strategies on a case-by-case basis, thereby increasing the effectiveness of assisting addicted individuals in relinquishing drug-seeking behavior. This approach aims to decrease long-term medical costs associated with prolonged drug and alcohol abuse using a novel approach in the identification of off target leukocyte and macrophage biomarker signatures for rapid and reliable diagnostics of drug use/abuse history. The technology developed will be utilized to gain further understanding of the underlying biological pathways that control addictive behav- ior, which is the first step to addressing destructive behavior on the personal level.           Project Narrative.

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           ","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7900036,U01AA017122,"['L1CAM ', ' L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule ', ' F11 Glycoprotein ', '

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          ",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7900032,U01AA014835,"['brain morphology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' Drug Design ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Supplementation ', ' Nutritional ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ', ' fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) ', ' embryopathia alcoholica ', ' embryofetal alcohol syndrome (EFAS) ', ' embryofetal alcohol syndrome ', ' alcoholic embryopathy ', ' Goltz-Gorlin syndrome ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' in utero ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Ethanol ', ' Methylcarbinol ', ' Grain Alcohol ', ' Ethyl Alcohol ', ' ETOH ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Los Angeles ', ' analog ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' New Mexico ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Animals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Exposure to ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Russia ', ' Russian SFSR ', ' Russian S.F.S.R.

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          ",Mouse Model

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          ",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,8121650,U01AA014835,"['Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1 ', ' Neural Adhesion Molecule L1 ', ' Nerve Growth Factor-Inducible Large External Glycoprotein ', ' NILE Protein ', ' NILE Glycoprotein ', ' NGF-Inducible Glycoprotein ', ' L1CAM ', ' L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule ', ' F11 Glycoprotein ', ' Cell Surface Glycoprotein L1 ', ' CamL1 Gene Product ', ' CALL Protein ', ' prenatal intervention ', ' northern plains ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' alcohol exposure ', ' exposure to alcohol ', ' exposed to alcohol ', ' ethanol exposure ', ' ethanol exposed ', ' alcohol exposed ', ' Early identification ', ' critical period ', ' literacy ', ' Sum ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' in utero ', ' Ethanol ', ' Methylcarbinol ', ' Grain Alcohol ', ' Ethyl Alcohol ', ' ETOH ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Choline ', ' 2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethyl-ethanaminium ', ' 2-Hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Informatics ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' brain behavior ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Sheep ', ' Ovis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' offspring ', ' Neonatal ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Nutritional ', ' reconstruction ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Mothers ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Mission ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Infant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Schools ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Emotional ', ' Toddler ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Africa ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' cognitive control ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' Collaborations ', ' Resolution ', ' Impairment ', ' Structure ', ' Technology ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Performance ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Woman ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Life ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Address ', ' Elements ', ' Clinical ', ' drinking ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Specificity ', ' Biology ', ' Future ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' Drug Design ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Methods ', ' Russia ', ' Russian SFSR ', ' Russian S.F.S.R.

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           ","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",8116049,U01AA017122,"['Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1 ', ' Neural Adhesion Molecule L1

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption. Isolating the effects of alcohol use and identifying risk markers is necessary to develop specifically targeted prevention and intervention strategies for youth.              The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will provide new information about the repair of alcohol-dependent individuals' self- control via working memory training and neurofeedback (real-time fMRI). By examining the brain regions that underlie impaired self-control before, during, and after intervention, we expect to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of self-control repair. We believe that a greater understanding of these neural mechanisms could lead to new and refined treatments for the pathologic decision-making seen in alcohol dependence.                ",The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI,8503919,R01AA021529,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' Medicine ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' technical report ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' self control ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' social ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' discounting ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neural model ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Network-based ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' ']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2013,586946,VA-09,0.12315739543147498
"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Excessive alcohol use is a major public health problem and incurs enormous costs to our society. By studying the subjective and physiological correlates of alcohol use, emotional dysregulation, and alcohol craving, this study will improve the conceptualization and assessment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), facilitate research on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.                 ","Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving",8485376,R21AA022099,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Alcoholic Beverages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' BPD ', ' Borderline Personality Disorder ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Crime ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electronics ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' indexing ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Moods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Societies ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Measures ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Reliance ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' Consult ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Testred ', ' Testovis ', ' Testotonic B ', ' Testomet ', ' Oreton methyl ', ' Orchisterone-M ', ' Neohombreol M ', ' Metandren ', ' Malogen ', ' Estratest ', ' Ero Test ', ' Eldec ', ' Android ', ' Glosso-Sterandryl ', ' Collection ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' positive mood ', ' negative mood ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Network-based ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' heart rate variability ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2013,207312,MO-04,0.2957298579735065

It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation.

"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will provide new information about the repair of alcohol-dependent individuals' self- control via working memory training and neurofeedback (real-time fMRI). By examining the brain regions that underlie impaired self-control before, during, and after intervention, we expect to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of self-control repair. We believe that a greater understanding of these neural mechanisms could lead to new and refined treatments for the pathologic decision-making seen in alcohol dependence.

"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Excessive alcohol use is a major public health problem and incurs enormous costs to our society. By studying the subjective and physiological correlates of alcohol use, emotional dysregulation, and alcohol craving, this study will improve the conceptualization and assessment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), facilitate research on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.

"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.                ",A

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.            ",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,8863672,K02AA023814,"['Acoustic ', '

"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will provide new information about the repair of alcohol-dependent individuals' self- control via working memory training and neurofeedback (real-time fMRI). By examining the brain regions that underlie impaired self-control before, during, and after intervention, we expect to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of self-control repair. We believe that a greater understanding of these neural mechanisms could lead to new and refined treatments for the pathologic decision-making seen in alcohol dependence.",The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI,8851460,R01AA021529,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' technical report ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' self control ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' social ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' discounting ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neural model ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Network-based ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2015,557036,VA-09,0.12315739543147498

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on

"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals. Results will inform the clinical ambiguity regarding cannabis use and treatment for AUD, which is particularly timely given that the recent decriminalization of cannabis in several US states may increase the frequency or severity of cannabis use in this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand how cannabis use among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders affects drinking after treatment. Results will help alcohol treatment providers better understand the risks associated with cannabis use for people of varying demographics and substance use histories.                ",How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes,8822758,R21AA023039,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anxiety ', ' 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione ', ' 1,3,7-Trimethylxanthine ', ' Caffeine ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' marijuana ', ' Marihuana ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Documentation ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Hemp Plant ', ' Cannabis ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' alcohol related consequences ', ' marijuana user ', ' policy implication ', ' ']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2015,148642,CA-13,0.3142238858589601
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,8867957,R01AA021661,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Finland ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Institutes ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Typology ', ' Veterans Affairs (U.S.) ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' forest ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Medical center ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' Proteome ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Alcoholism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' alcohol research ', ' comparative ', ' FDA approved ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2015,333922,PA-10,0.2018607858843919
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics.

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption. Isolating the effects of alcohol use and identifying risk markers is necessary to develop specifically targeted prevention and intervention strategies for youth.",The TEEN Study: The Impact of

"Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnitude and cost of alcohol and other drug (AOD) related problems originating in adolescence make it especially vital to monitor these behaviors, identify high-risk groups and evaluate preventive interventions such as policy measures. Adolescent substance use is associated with the four leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $25 billion in direct costs due to medical care and lost time at work annually. Denominator-based health surveillance systems provide population-representative structured data to inform policy and guide clinical and research objectives to address this problem. However, survey timeframes and sampling frames do not support real-time monitoring, robust subgroup investigation, flexible follow up or feedback of health alerts and information to subjects. Harnessing youth engagement with online social media to derive timely information about alcohol use behaviors and problems may accelerate public health awareness and drive targeted responses. The purpose of our project is to develop a new approach to public health surveillance of underage drinking that centers on mining social media communications in Facebook. The approach may: fill gaps in knowledge about risky, stigmatizing or sensitive behaviors; describe subgroups of youth who may not have opportunity/willingness to report about risk behaviors to public health authorities or clinicians; accelerate detection of trends to ""real time""; and, enable evaluation of policy interventions to resolve impacts at greater temporal-social-geographic levels. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 - Derive metrics of underage alcohol consumption from user-generated Facebook data, testing correspondence of social media and traditional surveillance reports at the state level. The approach is to collect text reports from the public profiles of US Facebook users ages 13-20 years, creating alcohol use metrics from these data by parsing, filtering and classifying them using machine learning techniques. The main hypotheses are that (1.a) patterns of underage drinking derived from social media will correlate with traditional surveillance reports and (1.b) vary in relation to seasons/events. Aim 2 - Establish the relationship between validated measures of the alcohol policy environment and measures of youth alcohol consumption obtained from social media. The approach is to ascertain associations among extant, validated alcohol policy scores measured at the state level and social media sourced measures of underage drinking and harms (from Aim 1). The main hypothesis is that social media metrics of underage alcohol use will be associated with alcohol policy at the state level. By utilizing the expertise of an experienced multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive rigorous approach, we anticipate findings that will advance public health methods for monitoring underage drinking and harms and generate a paradigm shift for policy evaluation by enabling real-time investigation of impacts at fine temporal- spatial resolution.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The magnitude of alcohol problems originating in adolescence make it one of the greatest and costliest health problems for this age group. In this work, we will derive and validate metrics of alcohol consumption from information posted on Facebook by underage youth from all 50 US states, and establish the relationship between these social media sourced metrics and surrounding state alcohol policies. Findings will enable a new approach to population surveillance of underage drinking that will complement traditional systems.                ",Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media,8870480,R21AA023901,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Americas ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will provide new information about the repair of alcohol-dependent individuals' self- control via working memory training and neurofeedback (real-time fMRI). By examining the brain regions that underlie impaired self-control before, during, and after intervention, we expect to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of self-control repair. We believe that a greater understanding of these neural mechanisms could lead to new and refined treatments for the pathologic decision-making seen in alcohol dependence.",The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI,9061508,R01AA021529,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' technical report ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' self control ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' social ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' discounting ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neural model ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Network-based ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' neural correlate ', ' ']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2016,548292,VA-09,0.12315739543147498
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.            ",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9104711,R01AA018673,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol

"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years. This knowledge will inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policies. Because of its experimental design, results will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points, including during childhood, by which to reduce the population burden of alcohol use.

"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals.

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9057931,K02AA023814,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' etoh

"Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnitude and cost of alcohol and other drug (AOD) related problems originating in adolescence make it especially vital to monitor these behaviors, identify high-risk groups and evaluate preventive interventions such as policy measures. Adolescent substance use is associated with the four leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $25 billion in direct costs due to medical care and lost time at work annually. Denominator-based health surveillance systems provide population-representative structured data to inform policy and guide clinical and research objectives to address this problem. However, survey timeframes and sampling frames do not support real-time monitoring, robust subgroup investigation, flexible follow up or feedback of health alerts and information to subjects. Harnessing youth engagement with online social media to derive timely information about alcohol use behaviors and problems may accelerate public health awareness and drive targeted responses. The purpose of our project is to develop a new approach to public health surveillance of underage drinking that centers on mining social media communications in Facebook. The approach may: fill gaps in knowledge about risky, stigmatizing or sensitive behaviors; describe subgroups of youth who may not have opportunity/willingness to report about risk behaviors to public health authorities or clinicians; accelerate detection of trends to ""real time""; and, enable evaluation of policy interventions to resolve impacts at greater temporal-social-geographic levels. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 - Derive metrics of underage alcohol consumption from user-generated Facebook data, testing correspondence of social media and traditional surveillance reports at the state level. The approach is to collect text reports from the public profiles of US Facebook users ages 13-20 years, creating alcohol use metrics from these data by parsing, filtering and classifying them using machine learning techniques. The main hypotheses are that (1.a) patterns of underage drinking derived from social media will correlate with traditional surveillance reports and (1.b) vary in relation to seasons/events. Aim 2 - Establish the relationship between validated measures of the alcohol policy environment and measures of youth alcohol consumption obtained from social media. The approach is to ascertain associations among extant, validated alcohol policy scores measured at the state level and social media sourced measures of underage drinking and harms (from Aim 1). The main hypothesis is that social media metrics of underage alcohol use will be associated with alcohol policy at the state level. By utilizing the expertise of an experienced multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive rigorous approach, we anticipate findings that will advance public health methods for monitoring underage drinking and harms and generate a paradigm shift for policy evaluation by enabling real-time investigation of impacts at fine temporal- spatial resolution. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The magnitude of alcohol problems originating in adolescence make it one of the greatest and costliest health problems for this age group. In this work, we will derive and validate metrics of alcohol consumption from information posted on Facebook by underage youth from all 50 US states, and establish the relationship between these social media sourced metrics and surrounding state alcohol policies. Findings will enable a new approach to population surveillance of underage drinking that will complement traditional systems.",Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media,9069662,R21AA023901,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Americas ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated.

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9121449,R01AA024391,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Communities ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' real time model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' standard of care ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' relapse patients ', ' relapse risk ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,381816,WI-02,0.17410167596401846
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,9035335,R01AA021661,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Finland ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Institutes ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Typology ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' forest ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Medical center ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' problem drinker ', ' Reporting ', ' Proteome ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Monitor ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Alcoholism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' comparative ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' screening ', ' biomarker development ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' ']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2016,344250,PA-10,0.2018607858843919
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.

"Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Over a quarter of primary care patients in the United States can be classified as unhealthy drinkers because their alcohol use conveys a high risk of health and social consequences. Unfortunately, unhealthy drinking is under-recognized in spite of the existence of valid screening tools. Even when unhealthy drinking is recognized, barriers such as provider discomfort, shortage of time, and stigma can inhibit appropriate care.  The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a new product to support detection and management of unhealthy drinking in medical settings. The Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) will improve clinical practice by combining existing proprietary software with two novel components. The first uses modern machine learning techniques and widely available pre-existing patient data (such as routine lab test results) to build an algorithm that will identify patients likely to be unhealthy drinkers. Publicly available national survey data will be used to develop a prediction model that will then be tested with a clinical data set. The second component is a data system (database, mobile app and related software) that interacts with the patient, providing proven behavior change interventions such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback, while simultaneously providing decision support to primary care providers. Iterative software development approaches will be used to create an app with a simple user interface and reporting functions.  PEARRS will provide a sophisticated tool for managing unhealthy alcohol use that will enable better quality of care, treatment outcomes, and cost savings.  AIM 1: To develop an algorithm to identify adults at elevated risk for unhealthy drinking  based on pre-existing objective laboratory tests.  AIM 2: To develop a prototype data system to actively engage patients and providers and  support evidence-based self-guided behavior change.  PEARRS addresses an unmet need for a low-cost method to reduce the clinical, social and financial burden of unhealthy alcohol use and will improve upon the status quo because laboratory markers will be used as screeners instead of self-report measures that are inconsistently used and can provoke resistance. Further, PEARRS will relieve providers of the need to perform a task they feel underprepared and unrewarded for.  The commercial applicability of this technological innovation is high because it is portable and relevant to a broad market of insurers, employers, accountable care organizations (ACOs) and others at risk for the consequences of unhealthy alcohol use. The impact PEARRS will have is substantial because it can overcome known barriers to providing alcohol evaluation and treatment services in general medical settings. PEARRS represents a fundamental shift in how unhealthy drinking is managed in medical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In some people, alcohol consumption can cause or complicate medical problems, accidents, lost productivity and crime. Although effective methods exist to identify unhealthy drinkers and help them reduce their risks, they are not widely used.

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9321946,K25AA025095,"['Affect ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New South Wales ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Siblings ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Family Study ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' American ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' family structure ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' tissue resource ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' nonalcoholic ', ' non-alcoholic ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Population ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcoholism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' risk sharing ', ' transcriptomics ', ' endophenotype ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' individualized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Data Analytics ', ' transcriptome ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2017,161460,CA-49,0.2591445974355886
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9391198,U01AA014809,"['adulthood

": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years. This knowledge will inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policies. Because of its experimental design, results will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points, including during childhood, by which to reduce the population burden of alcohol

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9384400,U24AA021697,"['adolescence

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for

"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority of individuals do not receive formal alcohol treatment, often because they believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era. Such technology, as pioneered in our phone app Alcogait, where gait is passively recorded during usual activities, could be used preventively to alert drinkers when they are passing various blood alcohol concentrations, and when they are legally intoxicated in real time based on gait impairment.",A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data,9307339,R21AA025193,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol intoxication ', ' EtOH intoxication ', ' Drunkenness ', ' Alcohol Intoxication ', ' Alcoholic Intoxication ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Phonation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' BrAC ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' Visit ', ' gait examination ', ' Gait Analysis ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' alcohol content ', ' ethanol content ', ' EtOH content ', ' drinking ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' binge drinking ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Reporting ', ' Intoxication ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' driving while impaired ', ' Impaired Driving ', ' impaired driving performance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' patient population ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIAAA,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R21,2017,228107,RI-01,0.23339605745364922
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9275293,R01AA024391,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' real time model ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' model development ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' alcohol services ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' alcohol involvement ', ' involvement with alcohol ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' relapse patients ', ' relapse risk ', ' relative cost ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,381816,WI-02,0.17410167596401846
"Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a critical need to develop non-invasive technologies to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time. Such technology would advance research assessing drinking in the natural environment, clinical platforms intervening in real-time, and justice applications. Currently developed technology, transdermal alcohol sensors (TAS), passively detect alcohol intoxication by continuously testing for alcohol excreted in sweat. While such technology provides continuous monitoring of alcohol consumption, there are several significant shortcomings that limit its utility in research and clinical contexts. Limitations include lack of temporal resolution (i.e., delay between drinking and sweat detection), poor sensitivity of drinking episodes that do not meet binge criteria, and lack of information about drinking topography.  In response to PAR-16-410, we propose to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a TAS device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior. The Lumme system combines the use of existing commercial hardware (smartwatch and smartphone) to assess drinking behavior in real time. The Lumme system uses inertial measurement units to record the movement of a person’s arm in three dimensional space with accelerometers and gyroscope contained in a smartwatch. Arm movements associated with drinking are distinctive, and can be accurately captured with a machine learning algorithm. The combined Lumme/TAS system complements one another’s strengths by providing detailed drinking data that can be linked to subsequent increases in blood alcohol content (BAC). The combined system will be able to accurately track drinking variables of interest to researchers and clinicians (e.g., start/end of drinking, length of drinking episode, rate of drinking, activity while drinking, social networks while drinking, location of drinking, and resulting BAC). Additionally, the gesture data can remotely capture low level drinking episodes that are undetected by existing TAS systems. We currently have a funded SBIR from NCI to develop and validate a smoking cessation platform using the Lumme system.  For the current application, we will propose a Phase I study to establish the feasibility and initial validity of using the combined Lumme/TAS system for tracking alcohol use behavior in real time. We plan to video record ad-libitum drinking behavior in heavy drinkers fitted with both a TAS system (BACtrack Skyn) and our Lumme system. The data collected in the clinical setting will act as ground truth which will be used to train our machine learning algorithm that will be sensitive to (i) how drinking gestures may change as blood alcohol levels rise (ii) how gestures may be affected by type of alcohol and the drinking vessel.  To our knowledge, the Lumme system would be the first system to remotely detect drinking gestures using a machine learning algorithm. In addition to improving real-time BAC detection technology the Lumme system could be also developed to deliver just-in-time interventions for problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use results in 88,000 annual deaths in the US and has an annual economic burden on $249 billion. We are proposing to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a transdermal alcohol sensor device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior in non-clinical settings.",Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection,9464482,R43AA026492,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol intoxication ', ' EtOH intoxication ', ' Drunkenness ', ' Alcohol Intoxication ', ' Alcoholic Intoxication ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Hand ', ' Justice ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Sweat ', ' perspiration ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' drinking ', ' Devices ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' drinking behavior ', ' alcohol monitoring ', ' alcohol testing ', ' ethanol testing ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' complement system ', ' arm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' arm movement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NIAAA,"LUMME, INC.",R43,2017,224228,MA-02,0.25471786277729486
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for

"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will provide new information about the repair of alcohol-dependent individuals' self- control via working memory training and neurofeedback (real-time fMRI). By examining the brain regions that underlie impaired self-control before, during, and after intervention, we expect to provide novel insights into the neurobiology of self-control repair. We believe that a greater understanding of these neural mechanisms could lead to new and refined treatments for the pathologic decision-making seen in alcohol dependence.",The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI,9272787,R01AA021529,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' Reporting ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' discount ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' discounting ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Network-based ', ' reward processing ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' follow up assessment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' neural correlate ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,548292,VA-09,0.12315739543147498
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual

"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9503952,R01CA225845,"['Advertising ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcoholic Beverages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Vectors ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' NASA ', ' United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' cancer risk ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' Cigarette ', ' Communication Methods ', ' movie ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' drinking ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Communication Research ', ' Tobacco Surveillance ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' early onset ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' translational medicine ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' movie exposure ', ' computer cluster ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' ']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,627735,NH-02,0.17349914413186718
"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9643182,R01AA027264,"['alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influentials ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Vivitrol ', ' ReVia ', ' Nemexin ', ' Nalorex ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walking ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' journal article ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' health science research ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' model design ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' tool development ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' trial design ', ' simulation-based learning ', ' simulation game ', ' power analysis ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' ']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,715938,IN-04,0.20880230979428313
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9524811,U01AA014809,"['Adult ', '

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9493347,R01AA024391,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' real time model ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' model development ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' coping ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' involvement with alcohol ', ' alcohol involvement ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' personalized care ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' relapse patients ', ' relapse risk ', ' relative cost ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,381816,WI-02,0.17410167596401846
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9534472,K25AA025095,"['Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New South Wales ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Siblings ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Family Study ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' American ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' family structure ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' tissue resource ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' nonalcoholic ', ' non-alcoholic ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Population ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' Alcoholism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' risk sharing ', ' transcriptomics ', ' endophenotype ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' alcohol research ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' precision prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' Data Analytics ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' transcriptome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' ']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2018,161460,CA-49,0.2591445974355886
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9477551,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', '

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9524807,U24AA014811,"['program dissemination ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' improved outcome ', ' diagnostic

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9523393,U24AA021697,"['Adolescence ',

"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9426777,R01AA026368,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Physics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Assimilations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' alcohol level ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' BrAC ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' diaries ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' Biosensor ', ' biological sensor ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' drinking ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' portability ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' alcoholism therapy ', ' alcoholism treatment ', ' alcohol dependence therapy ', ' alcohol addiction therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' physiologic model ', ' software systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Plug-in ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' alcohol research ', ' response to ethanol ', ' response to alcohol ', ' ethanol response ', ' alcohol response ', ' population based ', ' data reduction ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,586877,CA-37,0.26958579668407306
"A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake Heavy alcohol use is common, yet avoidable cause of death, disability and human suffering. These adverse outcomes are potentially avoidable if heavy alcohol use is spotted early. However, current screening methods for chronic alcohol consumption capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive, non-specific protein assays. In a recent highly successful Phase II project, using DNA from whole blood, we demonstrated that a combination of just two methylation sensitive droplet digital PCR (MSddPCR) assays could quite accurately identify subjects with recent heavy alcohol consumption. Since then, we have continued to advance those findings and have developed additional, even more powerful MSddPCR assays and refined our processes to only require the DNA found in a single drop of blood. In conjunction with our ethics and marketing team, we are now in the process of rolling this product nationwide.  However, a significant barrier to a more universal implementation of this disruptive technology is the requirement for blood. Conceivably, a test that could use the DNA from saliva could circumvent patient concerns about the discomfort of a needle or lancet stick. In addition, it would enable both non-medically oriented alcohol treatment programs and telemedicine oriented treatment programs to more easily assess client response to treatment. This will be particularly critical for treatment of alcoholism in the elderly, who are often unable or unwilling to travel to alcohol treatment facilities.  In this Phase I proposal, we intend to take the next steps to the creation of a saliva DNA screening test for heavy alcohol consumption. Already, we have collected and prepared saliva DNA on 150 subjects recently admitted to alcohol treatment and 150 age, gender and ethnicity matched controls. In addition, we have also developed an MSddPCR assay that can adjust for cellular heterogeneity in the saliva DNA.  In this application, we will use these resources to whether MSddPCR assessments of saliva DNA can also be used to detect heavy alcohol consumption. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine methylation status at 4 CpG loci with high predictive power for detecting alcohol consumption and one locus whose information content can be used to correct for cellular admixture in saliva. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a series of quality assessment of the saliva DNA. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the data from our 4 highly predictive loci, correcting when necessary for cellular admixture, to determine an algorithm capable of predicting heavy alcohol use status. In addition, we will analyze the quality control measures to identify those saliva DNA samples which give unreliable. As a result of this project, we will produce a set of MSddPCR assays and a quality control metric for a rigorous multisite Phase II test of this “bloodless” NextGen product. Narrative Current diagnostic approaches for the assessment of heavy alcohol use normally use blood.

"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority of individuals do not receive formal alcohol treatment, often because they believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era. Such technology, as pioneered in our phone app Alcogait, where gait is passively recorded during usual activities, could be used preventively to alert drinkers when they are passing various blood alcohol concentrations, and when they are legally intoxicated in real time based on gait impairment.",A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data,9532068,R21AA025193,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcoholic Intoxication ', ' ethanol intoxication ', ' EtOH intoxication ', ' Drunkenness ', ' Alcohol Intoxication ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' BrAC ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' Visit ', ' gait examination ', ' Gait Analysis ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' alcohol content ', ' ethanol content ', ' EtOH content ', ' drinking ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' binge drinking ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Reporting ', ' Intoxication ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' driving while impaired ', ' Impaired Driving ', ' impaired driving performance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' patient population ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' ']",NIAAA,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R21,2018,176960,RI-01,0.23339605745364922
"1-D Titania Nanostructure Based Wearable Alcohol Sensor with Tunable Sensitivity and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearable, non- invasive, smart, and aesthetic. The aim, in Phase I, is to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metal (i.e., Cobalt) functionalized Titanium nanotubes (TiNT) to detect, monitor, and display blood alcohol levels in real-time using microcontrollers-based wrist-band like devices. At the core of our innovation, we have Cobalt- functionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin in 1ppm level that can be tuned down to 1ppb level as well (i.e., sensitivity of the sensor is tunable). The control unit of our system is reusable, sensors are replaceable, the microcontrollers are equipped with a micro-SD card for personal-data storage, and the proposed unit has a built-in wireless system for data transmission. This proposal also aims, in Phase II, to create an integrated artificially intelligent (AI) network that will have the capabilities of (a) translating the real-time data into a pre-cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety features through a wireless signal (i.e., Bluetooth), and (c) adaptively taking unattended decisions-on-demand (DoD) through machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicated. 1 Project Narrative Breath-analyzers within the law enforcement settings alone cannot tackle the problems associated with alcohol consumptions and abuse. Recently developed wearable alcohol sensor technologies mostly rely on wet-electrochemical environments around the skin.

"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at

"Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning Project Summary Development of general and efficient methods for functionalization of alcohols is highly warranted due to the ubiquity and prominence of this functional group in natural products. Such methods would allow for late-stage diversification of complex molecules and, consequently, could have a broad impact in natural product synthesis and preparation of relevant pharmaceutical materials. However, owing to the chemical inertness of alcohols, most methods typically require installation of activating groups for functionalization, making them unattractive from an atom- and step-economical perspective. Nonetheless, many advances have been made. In particular, the Barton-McCombie reaction has become an indispensable tool for reductive functionalization of alcohols. Unfortunately, this transformation requires pre- functionalization of the alcohol substrate, employs highly toxic tin reagents, and invokes the use high reaction temperatures or harmful UV light for initiation of radical intermediates. Furthermore, the overall transformation is limited to H-atom incorporation or reductive coupling with alkenes. Lastly, only a few deoxygenation methods exist that are amenable for late-stage and site-selective deoxygenation in complex systems. Moreover, physical organic chemistry tools available to facilitate the selection of a set of conditions or parameters to afford site-selectivity are limited. In this proposal, we will develop a mild and practical photocatalytic deoxygenation of alcohols. Our strategy will focus on solving the inherent limitation of the Barton McCombie reaction by 1) avoiding the use of toxic tin reagents, 2) obviating the need for pre-functionalization of the alcohol substrate, and 3) allowing for modular coupling of formed alkyl radicals via Ni-catalysis. Specific aim 1 explores the development of a novel photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenation of alcohols. In addition, we outline a general protocol for deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols via inception of the alkyl radical intermediate, formed via β-scission, with various radical electrophiles. Moreover, we highlight an innovative method for the direct cross-coupling of alcohols via metallophotoredox catalysis in both racemic and enantioselective fashion. Specific aim 2 addresses the design strategy for implementing physical chemistry techniques such as Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space. Also, we outline applying this strategy to identify a set of optimal conditions to confer site-selective functionalization in complex polyols. Project Narrative Mild and site-controlled deoxygenation of alcohols could significantly accelerate the late-stage synthesis/diversification of important organic molecules; however, current methods often employ toxic tin reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and require prefunctionalization of the alcohols employed. The strategy proposed would allow for a mild photocatalytic deoxygenation, as well as deoxyfunctionalization, of alcohols that solves the aforementioned limitations of prior art. Moreover, the proposed strategy outlines implementation of physical organic chemistry tools Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space.",Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning,9759306,F32GM129910,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alkenes ', ' Olefins ', ' Arts ', ' Catalysis ', ' Organic Chemistry ', ' Physical Chemistry ', ' Employment ', ' Methods ', ' phosphane ', ' Phosphines ', ' Reagent ', ' Temperature ', ' Stannum ', ' Sn element ', ' Tin ', ' ultraviolet radiation ', ' ultraviolet light ', ' UV radiation ', ' UV light ', ' Actinic Rays ', ' Ultraviolet Rays ', ' polyol ', ' catalyst ', ' Site ', ' Chemicals ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' functional group ', ' Intercept ', ' novel ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Organic Synthesis ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' alcohol involvement ', ' involvement with alcohol ', ' Natural Products ', ' predictive tools ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,NJ-12,0.2677138510521932
"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention.

"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9698853,U24AA021697,"['Adolescence ',

"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9692448,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', '

"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,9713715,R01AA027553,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Names ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk drinking ', ' risky drinking ', ' at-risk drinking ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Alcohol Phenotype ', ' alcoholic phenotype ', ' Abstinence ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' brain research ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' alcohol use initiation ', ' drinking initiation ', ' alcohol initiation ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' predictive tools ', ' connectome ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' imaging study ', ' neural network ', ' connectome based predictive modeling ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,463176,CT-03,0.24872947467392936
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9709183,R01AA024391,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' real time model ', ' realtime model ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' model development ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' alcohol involvement ', ' involvement with alcohol ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' relapse patients ', ' relapse risk ', ' relative cost ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' mHealth application ', ' mHealth app ', ' m-Health application ', ' m-Health app ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,381816,WI-02,0.17410167596401846
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9675194,R01AA026368,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Physics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Running ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Assimilations ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' alcohol level ', ' ETOH level ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' BrAC ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' diaries ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' Biosensor ', ' biological sensor ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' drinking ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' portability ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ', ' BACs ', ' BAC clone ', ' alcoholism therapy ', ' alcoholism treatment ', ' alcohol dependence therapy ', ' alcohol addiction therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' physiologic model ', ' software systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Plug-in ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' alcohol response ', ' response to ethanol ', ' response to alcohol ', ' ethanol response ', ' population based ', ' data reduction ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,508222,CA-37,0.26958579668407306
"Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking Project Summary  Although alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects a large segment of American adults and the current treatments are unsuccessful in a significant proportion of patients. Studying the neural underpinnings of AUD has the potential for uncovering target for developing novel treatments. There is mounting evidence that AUD is correlated with dysregulated synchrony within the corticostriatal network. Neuromodulatory therapies, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been successful at treating other disorders, like Parkinson's disease, characterized by network dysregulation. Although, DBS has also shown the potential to treat AUD in pre- clinical models and clinical studies, the variable response to treatment (~50% of subject) limits the clinical adoption of these techniques. If we are able to uncover which measures of corticostriatal synchrony are implicated in the therapeutic effects of DBS, then we could target those features to increase response rates and open the door to a new therapeutic approach to AUD.  The short-term objective of this research is to uncover the synchrony measure indicative of successful DBS treatment of AUD and then improve outcomes by targeting that measure with a novel DBS approach. The longer-term objective is to develop a novel treatment modality—dual-site DBS—which could be used to target dysregulated synchrony between two brain regions by targeting both of those regions. To achieve both of these objectives, (Aim 1) I will use a rodent model of alcohol drinking and an unbiased computational approach to determine what corticostriatal synchrony measure best correlates with successful single-site DBS. Next (Aim 2a), I will determine if dual-site DBS can be optimized to selectively modulate the measure previously associated with alcohol drinking. Last, (Aim 2b) I will test the ability of dual-site DBS to alter both synchrony and drinking behavior compared to single-site DBS.  These aims will not only provide a brain network-based biomarker of successful AUD treatment, but also begin the development of an innovative treatment. To complete these aims I will work with my mentorship team at Dartmouth College on the use of animal models of alcohol use, the analysis of local field potentials, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms. Dartmouth College not only provides cutting-edge facilities which I will use to complete this research, but also has dedicated centers for professional development like the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, which I will use over the next two years. Altogether, the training I will receive under this F31 will be integral in my pursuit of a pre-clinical research career. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 15 million adults in the United States with a particular need for new therapeutic options in the treatment resistant population. Brain network dysregulation is implicated in AUD, specifically dysregulated corticostriatal synchrony, and this proposal will uncover the relationship between corticostriatal synchrony induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) and reduced alcohol drinking in an animal model. Further, this proposal will determine if a novel application of DBS is able to reduce alcohol drinking more than standard DBS by manipulating this dysregulated synchrony.",Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking,9854732,F31AA027441,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' Network-based ', ' alcohol exposure ', ' exposure to ethanol ', ' exposure to alcohol ', ' exposed to ethanol ', ' exposed to alcohol ', ' ethanol exposure ', ' ethanol exposed ', ' alcohol exposed ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' reduced alcohol use ', ' signal processing ', ' pedagogy ', ' improved outcome ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIAAA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,F31,2019,45016,NH-02,0.2525664322435426
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,9913250,R01AA027916,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' embryopathia alcoholica ', ' embryofetal alcohol syndrome ', ' alcoholic embryopathy ', ' Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Growth Disorders ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methylation ', ' microencephaly ', ' micrencephaly ', ' Microcephaly ', ' Parents ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxin ', ' Mediating ', ' Malnutrition ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' fetal diagnosis ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' alcohol effect ', ' ethanol effect ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' ARND ', ' Dysmorphology ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Experimental Animal Model ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Fetal Alcohol Exposure ', ' prenatally exposed to alcohol ', ' prenatally alcohol exposed ', ' pregnancy ethanol exposure ', ' pregnancy alcohol exposure ', ' pregnancy ETOH exposure ', ' gestational ethanol exposure ', ' gestation ethanol exposure ', ' gestation alcohol exposure ', ' gestation ETOH exposure ', ' exposed to alcohol prenatally ', ' alcohol-exposed pregnancy ', ' Prenatal Ethanol Exposure ', ' Prenatal ETOH Exposure ', ' Prenatal Alcohol Exposure ', ' In Utero Ethanol Exposure ', ' In Utero ETOH Exposure ', ' In Utero Alcohol Exposure ', ' Fetal Ethanol Exposure ', ' Fetal ETOH Exposure ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disability ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ', ' FASD ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' imprint ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,597565,NY-13,0.06962465543658714
"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,9906637,F32AA028148,"['Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', '

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for

"Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Early onset of alcohol use during adolescence is associated with increased probability of later alcohol dependence, polydrug abuse, victimization, conduct problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and delayed achievement of adult milestones. Methods that yield rapid, accurate, and reliable predictions of which children and teens are at risk for early onset can improve the targeting of prevention interventions and enable the concentration of resources on the most debilitating and costly cases. One promising and untapped approach to this prediction problem is machine learning (also called “statistical learning,” “data mining,” or “predictive modeling”), a class of techniques arising from statistics, computer science, and engineering that seeks to build data-driven predictive algorithms. These techniques are most noticeably distinguished from “traditional” statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) by their extreme emphasis on prediction of future cases, rather than explanation of the current data, and thus they may offer dramatic advantages over traditional approaches to identifying which children and teens will develop early onset alcohol use. This proposal will explore the potential contribution of machine learning methods by directly comparing their predictive performance to that of the traditional approach in a large-scale, multisite longitudinal study of the development of early onset alcohol use (N = 731). If machine learning methods do significantly outperform the traditional approach, future directions might include the development and implementation of machine-learning- based screening methods for real-world use. On the other hand, if machine learning methods do not outperform the traditional approach, this will suggest that at least in the context of the present study (i.e., these predictors, timeline, and outcome), machine learning does not improve the prediction of early onset alcohol use. Analyses will investigate whether the performance of machine learning methods varies across the nature of predictor variables use, the age span covered, and the outcome to be predicted. Thus, the current proposal uses an extant longitudinal dataset to carry out two specific aims: (1) Train five different machine learning algorithms and one traditional algorithm (ordinary logistic regression) for predicting later early onset alcohol use in a subset (70%) of the data. (2) Test these six predictive algorithms on the rest (30%) of the data and directly compare their predictive performance in multiple contexts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prospectively predicting which children and teens are at risk for early onset alcohol use enables targeted implementation of preventive interventions. Machine learning is a promising yet untapped approach that may be well-suited to this task.

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus.

"Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer ABSTRACT A contribution of alcohol to the development of several cancers, including esophageal, laryngeal, lung, breast (in women) and colorectal (especially in men), is becoming increasingly evident. Each year, 390,000 cases of cancer world-wide are attributable to alcohol consumption, representing 3.6% of all newly diagnosed cancers. The International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer (ICAC) was established in 2010 to complement the major research conferences in cancer (e.g. AACR) and alcohol (e.g., RSA, ISBRA, ESBRA) which do not have a focus on the role of alcohol in carcinogenesis. After the success of the first three meetings (in Heidelberg, Germany in 2011; Breckenridge, USA in 2013; and Crete, Greece in 2015), we are now in the process of organizing our fourth conference. The conferences have been successful in bringing together over fifty investigators (from sixteen nations) with cutting-edge and complementary expertise in alcohol and cancer. In addition to allowing experts to share their most current results, the conference has promoted interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In so doing, it has fostered the development of valuable new collaborations that promote major advances in the field. An important secondary function of this conference is to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research. This R13 application seeks mostly travel support for new investigators, and pre- and post-doctoral trainees to allow attendance at the fourth ICAC to be held in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, on April 14-18, 2019. The conference will remain faithful to and build upon the previous conferences by achieving the following specific aims: i) provide a venue for the presentation of cutting-edge research in the field of alcohol and cancer; ii) promote the development of new ideas and research directions by fostering interactions and collaborations between researchers from a variety of sub-specialties and disciplines; iii) foster interactions between young investigators (including postgraduate and graduate students) and established investigators; iv) facilitate distribution of new scientific and translational information to the professional and lay communities, and v) disseminate the findings of the meeting to a wider audience by publishing the presentations. It is anticipated that these conferences will continue to enhance our understanding of the role played by alcohol in carcinogenesis and thereby facilitate the development of treatments that will prevent or treat cancers caused by alcohol. PROJECT NARRATIVE The contribution of alcohol to the development of a variety of cancers is becoming increasingly evident. The proposed meeting will focus on recent advances in epidemiology, molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis, and the emerging areas of systems approaches, big data, deep learning and artificial intelligence. As has been the case previously, this meeting will function as an ideal platform for promoting interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, it will serve to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research.",Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer,9771126,R13AA027725,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Crete ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Germany ', ' Greece ', ' Inflammation ', ' voice box ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Rhode Island ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Area ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Endocrinologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' posters ', ' Scientist ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' International ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' AACR ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Esophageal ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cancer stem cell ', ' malignant stem cell ', ' cancer type ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,30000,CT-03,0.2226795762987736
"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative

"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9698228,U24AA014811,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Animal

"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to

"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively.

"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9656103,R01CA225845,"['Advertising ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcoholic Beverages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disease Vectors ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immersion ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' NASA ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' Cigarette ', ' Communication Methods ', ' movie ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' drinking ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Communication Research ', ' Tobacco Surveillance ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' early onset ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' translational medicine ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' movie exposure ', ' computer cluster ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531248,NH-02,0.17349914413186718
"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9787254,R01AA027264,"['alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influentials ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Vivitrol ', ' ReVia ', ' Nemexin ', ' Nalorex ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walking ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' journal article ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' health science research ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' model design ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tool development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' trial design ', ' simulation game ', ' simulation-based learning ', ' power analysis ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' online registry ', ' ']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,680219,IN-04,0.20880230979428313
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9753834,K25AA025095,"['Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New South Wales ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Siblings ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Family Study ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' American ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' family structure ', ' problem drinker ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' Boozer ', ' Alcoholic ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' tissue resource ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epigenomics ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' non-alcoholic ', ' nonalcoholic ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Population ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Alcoholism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' risk sharing ', ' transcriptomics ', ' endophenotype ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol related research ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' individualized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' ']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2019,161460,CA-49,0.2591445974355886
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.

"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9988982,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9981554,K25AA025095,"['Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New South Wales ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Siblings ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Family Study ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' American ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' family structure ', ' Alcoholic ', ' Boozer ', ' Dependent drinker ', ' problem drinker ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' tissue resource ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' nonalcoholic ', ' non-alcoholic ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Population ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' Alcoholism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' risk sharing ', ' transcriptomics ', ' endophenotype ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol research ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' complex data  ', ' ']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2020,161460,CA-49,0.2591445974355886
": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol is an important nonessential component of diet that has been implicated in having both positive and negative effects on the skeleton. The proposed studies will evaluate the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy, and very heavy) on bone in a non-human primate model for voluntary drinking that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in

"Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption and Mental Health in Young People PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is unprecedented in its impact on individuals, societies, and the economy. Of special consideration is the effect of the pandemic on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of young people. Here, we propose leveraging the longitudinal, multi-site National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study (2012-2022) to investigate changes in wellbeing and behaviors, with a focus on alcohol use in response to the pandemic, in an established sample of young people including moderate-heavy users and those at risk for alcohol use, and to identify risk and protective factors for distress in response to the pandemic. Using NCANDA, we are able to directly address research objectives of NOSI NOT-OD-20-097 to understand social, behavioral and economic impacts from containment and mitigation efforts implemented to reduce spread of the COVID-19 disease, as well as downstream health impacts including substance use/abuse, and to determine risk and resiliency factors and outcomes. Unlike most research in this area, NCANDA includes neurobiological data critical to complement clinical and self-report data in understanding the complex and dynamic interactions leading up to and following a disaster. Also, with its accelerated longitudinal design and current age of participants spanning 17-28 years old, NCANDA is uniquely powered to disentangle age and pandemic related effects, unlike traditional same-age cohort designs. We propose supplementing the NCANDA project with a brief COVID-19 survey about alcohol use, mood, and other behaviors during the pandemic as well as COVID-19 exposure and pandemic-related distress, administered to participants in June 2020. To track long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey will be re-administered in Winter 2020 and Summer 2021. By embedding this survey, time-linked to the pandemic, within the existing NCANDA dataset, we propose characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use, mental health, and brain in young people (Aim 1) and to evaluate risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 pandemic-related distress (Aim 2). We propose using advanced analytics, including machine learning approaches, to identify a `signature' from the rich information captured by neuroimaging, clinical and self-report data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, that predicts distress versus resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. A machine-learning approach embraces the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic-related influence and takes advantage of the multi-domains within the NCANDA dataset. The analysis proposed in this supplement will offer valuable longitudinal data in a well-characterized sample of young people who are bridging developmental years into adulthood and that includes those at high risk for, or current heavy users of, alcohol. Such information can be used to guide public health and intervention strategies to benefit vulnerable young populations in the event of future disasters.

"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes.

"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively.

"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9902264,R01AA026368,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Physics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Assimilations ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol level ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' BrAC ', ' alcohol breath analysis ', ' assay of breath alcohol ', ' assay of breath ethanol ', ' breath alcohol concentration ', ' breath alcohol test ', ' breath ethanol concentration ', ' breath ethanol measurement ', ' breath ethanol test ', ' ethanol breath analysis ', ' breath alcohol measurement ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blood Alcohol Content ', ' blood alcohol concentration ', ' blood alcohol level ', ' Blood alcohol level measurement ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' drinking ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' time interval ', ' portability ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' BAC clone ', ' BACs ', ' Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ', ' alcohol addiction therapy ', ' alcohol dependence therapy ', ' alcoholism treatment ', ' alcoholism therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' physiologic model ', ' software systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Plug-in ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol research ', ' ethanol response ', ' response to alcohol ', ' response to ethanol ', ' alcohol response ', ' population based ', ' data reduction ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematical methods ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,500910,CA-37,0.26958579668407306
"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to

"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10023145,R01AA027916,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Alcohol Syndrome ', ' alcoholic embryopathy ', ' embryofetal alcohol syndrome ', ' embryopathia alcoholica ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth Disorders ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methylation ', ' Microcephaly ', ' micrencephaly ', ' microencephaly ', ' Parents ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxin ', ' Mediating ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Malnutrition ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' fetal diagnosis ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' ethanol effect ', ' alcohol effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' ARND ', ' Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Dysmorphology ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Animal Model ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Fetal ETOH Exposure ', ' Fetal Ethanol Exposure ', ' In Utero Alcohol Exposure ', ' In Utero ETOH Exposure ', ' In Utero Ethanol Exposure ', ' Prenatal Alcohol Exposure ', ' Prenatal ETOH Exposure ', ' Prenatal Ethanol Exposure ', ' alcohol-exposed pregnancy ', ' exposed to alcohol prenatally ', ' gestation ETOH exposure ', ' gestation alcohol exposure ', ' gestation ethanol exposure ', ' gestational ethanol exposure ', ' pregnancy ETOH exposure ', ' pregnancy alcohol exposure ', ' pregnancy ethanol exposure ', ' prenatally alcohol exposed ', ' prenatally exposed to alcohol ', ' Fetal Alcohol Exposure ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disability ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' FASD ', ' Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' imprint ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,632755,NY-13,0.06962465543658714
"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9999397,R01AA027264,"['alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influentials ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walking ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' journal article ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' health science research ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' model design ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' tool development ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' trial design ', ' simulation-based learning ', ' simulation game ', ' power analysis ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' online registry ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' treatment research ', ' ']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,671748,IN-04,0.20880230979428313
"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,9973396,R01AA026879,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Individuality ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Psychological Models ', ' Psychologic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Risk factors like age, obesity, and comorbidity impact the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID- 19 leading to hospital ICU admission and death. Additional risk factors that promote exaggerated immune and inflammatory response to the virus leading to severe disease or death must exist. One such risk factor could be alcohol consumption because: (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States. (2) Patients hospitalized for pneumonia who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk for developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (the primary cause of death in COVID-19) than non-AUD patients; and (3) Alcohol negatively impacts function of the immune system and results in an inappropriate response to pathogens (a primary mechanism of severe COVID-19 and ARDS); and (4) Alcohol disrupts the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal and lung barriers which can both further promote inflammation and contribute to ARDS. Accordingly, we hypothesize that alcohol misuse is an independent risk factor that increases the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by promoting exaggerated and dysregulated immune- inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage our COVID-19 data and biorepository at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which has tested over 22,000 patients (68% minority) with over 6000 patients testing positive, over 1000 hospitalized, over 600 critically ill. Currently, all patients arriving at RUMC are screened for alcohol use with AUDIT. Our COVID-19 biorepository has banked nasopharyngeal swabs, serum/plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine if alcohol use or misuse increases severity of COVID-19 and elucidate interactions with other risk factors. In this cross sectional study, we will use a machine learning classifier to determine if increased alcohol use/misuse are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poorer COVID-19 health outcomes (in 12,000 RUMC, 6000 COVID-19+) patients. Aim 2. Determine the impact of alcohol use and misuse on COVID-19 disease course and the impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption. In this longitudinal study, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of alcohol use in 6000 patients positive for COVID-19 to determine: (2a) if alcohol use/misuse is associated with slower recovery from COVID-19-associated symptoms. Aim 3. Determine if alcohol misuse results in exaggerated immune-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and more organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and explore the mechanisms. In this mechanistic Aim, we will compare COVID-19 patients with different disease severity to determine if alcohol misuse is associated with: (3a) altered immune/inflammatory response. (3b) disrupted intestinal barrier integrity. We will use machine learning and other advanced informatics approaches to investigate these Aims to discover new mechanisms for alcohol-COVID-19 interactions for prevention and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed and threatens our society. However we know very little about the underlying mechanisms and comorbidities that cause severe symptoms in some COVID-19 patients. Alcohol use has been shown to make the flu and other respiratory diseases worse and we think this may be true for COVID-19 and alcohol as well. This study will investigate if alcohol use makes COVID-19 worse and how. Identifying this new information about COVID-19 pathology and a role for alcohol could support new recommendations from physicians regarding alcohol and new targets for COVID-19 patient therapies.",Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19,10163399,R24AA026801,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anxiety ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Coughing ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Morbidity -

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9961331,U24AA021697,"['Adolescence ',

"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention. This study will continue to refine an empirically supported smartphone app (Step Away) and develop a similarly focused chatbot that will serve as a personal assistant to an individual interested in changing their drinking. We will also perform a pilot study that will compare user engagement and alcohol outcome variables across the two approaches.",Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App?

"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at

"Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers Summary:  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices.

"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative

"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.
