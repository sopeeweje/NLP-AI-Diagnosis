"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          ",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,7797472,R01CA077850,"['Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' calcification ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Hybrids ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' indexing ', ' Lesion ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Investigation ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Ipsilateral ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Performance ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' visual search ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,278249,PA-18,0.09733725572953628
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data. Relevance: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.           ",Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra,7797540,R01EB007057,"['Complex Mixtures ', ' small molecule ', ' FOLH1 gene ', ' PSM ', ' NAALAD1 ', ' FOLH1 ', ' FOLH ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Protein Biochemistry ', ' Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Collection ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Set protein ', ' Template Activating Factor I Beta ', ' SET Translocation Inhibitor-2 of Protein Phosphatase-2A ', ' Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor I2PP2A ', ' Inhibitor of GZMA-Activated DNase ', ' IGAAD ', ' HLA-DR Associated Protein II ', ' Source Code ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Peptide Fragments ', ' Peptides ', ' Staging ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' tool ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Running ', ' Blast Cell ', ' Hemohistioblast ', ' Hemocytoblast ', ' Hematohistioblast ', ' Ferrata cell ', ' Blasts ', ' Silicon Dioxide ', ' Tridymite ', ' Silica ', ' Sand ', ' Cristobalite ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Authorship ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Calibration ', ' expectation ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Devices ', ' Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone ', ' Propanedinitrile, ((3-chlorophenyl)hydrazono)- ', ' Carbonyl Cyanide meta-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone ', ' CCCP ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Dissociation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' model design ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' disease phenotype ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' markov model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' task analysis ', ' computer cluster ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2010,593600,WA-07,0.1611793670831127
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             ",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7906880,R33CA126209,"['web-accessible ', ' biological systems ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' PTPN11 gene ', ' SHP2 ', ' SHP-2 ', ' SH-PTP3 ', ' SH-PTP2 ', ' PTPN11 ', ' PTP2C ', ' PTP-1D ', ' NS1 ', ' BPTP3 ', ' Address ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Resource Informatics ', ' Phosphorylation Site ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' src Homology Region 2 Domain ', ' SH2 Domains ', ' Peptide Mapping ', ' Peptide Fingerprinting ', ' Peptides ', ' Phosphopeptides ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Kinases ', ' EC 2.7 ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Staging ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' tool ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' protein profiling ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell division ', ' Measures ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' microchip ', ' protein aminoacid sequence ', ' peptide sequence ', ' peptide aminoacid sequence ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' database design ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Computational Science ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2010,498935,TX-18,0.06178282336144323
"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shotgun proteomics is one of the most commonly used approaches to MS-based biomarker discovery, due to its high throughput and sensitivity. The general strategy involves simultaneous protease digestion of all proteins in a mixture, liquid chromatography-based separation of peptides and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to produce fragmentation spectra of each peptide. Each experimental spectrum is searched against a protein database. Sequences that best match the experimental spectra are considered identified, while a set of reliably identified peptides from the same protein is necessary for a reliable protein identification. The main goal in the proposed work is to generate and interrogate MS/MS data from several proteomics platforms, including ESI/MS, MALDI/TOF/TOF, LC-IMS/TOF and MALDI-PID/TOF to develop customized computational tools that address several challenging problems in shotgun proteomics data analysis: peptide identification, protein identification and label-free protein quantification. Our proposed approach is data-driven. At its core is the application of machine learning methods to the prediction of peptide fragmentation spectra as well as the likelihood of peptide detection in a typical proteomics experiment. Improved peptide identification coupled with the predicted peptide delectability will then be used to develop new methods for improved protein identification and quantification. The methods proposed herein will be extensively evaluated and software will be made public both as web-based tools and open-source deliverables. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions. Such studies might entail disease diagnosis (biomarker discovery), disease progression (tissue profiling), or effects of treatment (drug-induced proteome changes). These studies will enhance understanding of diseases and hasten the development of effective treatments and cures. In addition, these tools will be useful in characterizing new analytical tools for proteome analysis. Here we propose to develop and extensively evaluate computational methodology that will be used to improve the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease.

"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          ",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,8065906,R01CA077850,"['Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Hybrids ', ' Breast ', ' Decision Making ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Scheme ', ' Lesion ', ' Reading ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Attitude ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Ipsilateral ', ' indexing ', ' Diagnostic ', ' clinical practice ', ' Investigation ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Environment ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Play ', ' Performance ', ' Methods ', ' Process ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Clinical ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' base ', ' Detection ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Time ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cues ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Reporting ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Area ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' calcification ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' visual search ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Benign ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,269902,PA-18,0.09733725572953628
"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.                  Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.          Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.          Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved.

"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children. Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.            ",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,8947210,R01HD084628,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cataloging ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', "" 1-Naphthalenesulfonic acid, 3,3'-((1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diylbis(azo))bis(4-amino)-, disodium salt "", ' Congo Red ', ' Crowding ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Decidua Graviditas ', ' Decidua ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application.

"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements.

However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions.

However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with

"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9344966,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' biotherapy ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biological treatment ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Process ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2017,1186500,MA-07,0.11404396538109261

"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9562959,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' biotherapy ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biological treatment ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2018,1186500,MA-07,0.11404396538109261
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9751141,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' biotherapy ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biological treatment ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2019,1186500,MA-07,0.11404396538109261
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anaphylaxis ', ' Anaphylactic Shock ', ' Anaphylactic Reaction ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' anti-virals ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hybridomas ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' In Vitro ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Project narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer

"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications. Project narrative In immune-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. Here we propose the first modern search for autoantibody biomarkers in ulcerative colitis, and a test of the hypothesis that anti-epithelial autoimmunity is a contributor to extreme phenotypes in this disease. If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications.",Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome,10112090,R21DK127189,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Archives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Colectomy ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Modernization ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Mediating ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Epithelial ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Pouch Ileitis ', ' Pouchitis ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Autoimmune ', ' Autoimmune Process ', ' cohort ', ' technological innovation ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Subgroup ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' microbiome ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' therapeutic target ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' study population ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' host microbiome ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' genomic locus ', ' ']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2020,250500,CA-28,0.010777792893750868
"Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver We propose to develop a multimodal mass spectrometry imaging pipeline with novel desorption sources and data integration that will enable simultaneously mapping of biomolecule abundance in 3-dimensions in biological tissues at high spatial resolution (micron to submicron) and high speed (>10 ms/pixel) in a near-native environment. This would provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi- omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB) operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e., frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets. We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including different modes of cell death.

"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Half-Life ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Modernization ', ' Peptides ', ' Cyclic Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Work ', ' Renaissance ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' globular protein ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Documentation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Mutate ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' combinatorial ', ' interoperability ', ' translational study ', ' open source ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' therapeutic target ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' Software Framework ', ' therapeutic peptide ', ' peptide drug ', ' predictive tools ', ' in silico ', ' virtual screenings ', ' virtual screening ', ' ']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,CA-49,0.1279301587763284
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Skyline Targeted Proteomics Environment Development on Skyline started in 2008 to fill a critical need for a software tool that enabled targeted proteomics experiments. Since then, Skyline has grown into an entire ecosystem of tools, expanding well beyond targeted proteomics. The Skyline software ecosystem is one of the most widely used software platforms in all of mass spectrometry, supporting thousands of investigators in their research. The synergy between Skyline software development and its vast and thriving user community uniquely generate exciting new opportunities for quantitative mass spectrometry. Skyline has been a key factor in the success and growth of this new field, with Skyline itself becoming one of the most significant software tools in mass spectrometry. Since 2015, we have expanded Skyline software, from just the traditional targeted proteomics experiments that used selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometers, to broadly encompass ALL types of quantitative proteomics experiments, including data dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments using MS1 peak areas (aka MS1 filtering), targeted tandem mass spectrometry (aka parallel reaction monitoring or PRM) experiments and data independent acquisition (DIA). As of Oct 2019, Skyline has been installed >97,500 times (117% increase since 2015), has over 14,000 registered users (122% increase since 2015) on its website (http://skyline.ms) and is booted up >9,000 times per week (exceeding 17,500 bootups in a single week). The Skyline project has grown beyond the bounds of a single tool. Currently, there are 14 Skyline external tools (55% increase since 2015) that rely on a formalized framework in Skyline and available through its tool store, with more still in development. The prior grant cycle has greatly expanded a community of users and developers working with a common set of tools to analyze quantitative data from all six major mass spectrometry vendors.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software.

"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR PROTEOFORM IDENTIFICATION BY TOP-DOWN DATA INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION MASS SPECTROMETRY Summary Mass spectrometry-based top-down proteomics has become one of the most informative approaches in protein analysis because it provides the bird's-eye view of intact proteoforms (protein forms) generated from post-translational modifications and sequence variations. Data dependent acquisition and data independent acquisition are the two main methods in top-down mass spectrometry. The former has been the dominant one, but it has two main challenges in proteome-wide studies: low protein coverage: a regular experiment of human cells can identify only 200 – 400 proteins, and low reproducibility: a technical triplet shares only about one third of identified proteoforms. Top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (TD-DIA-MS) has the potential to significantly increase protein coverage and improve reproducibility in proteome-wide studies. However, its application has been hampered by the complexity of the data and the lack of efficient software tools. To address this problem, we will propose new algorithms and machine learning models and develop the first software package for proteoform identification by TD-DIA-MS. The proposed research will be conducted by a group of researchers with complementary expertise. All the proposed algorithms will be implemented as user-friendly open source software tools. Narrative This project addresses the proteoform identification problem by top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We will propose new machine learning models and new algorithms for high-throughput proteome-wide identification of complex proteoforms with post-translational modifications and sequence variations by using top- down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry.

"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Project narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture.

"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9928344,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Chimp ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Pan Species ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2020,1186500,MA-07,0.11404396538109261
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry The identification and quantification of biological macromolecules remains challenging despite major advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition, fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on- the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins, enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.  Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart disease and neurodegeneration.",Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry,10081127,R43GM139467,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Digital Signal Processing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Isoleucine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leucine ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Peptides ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transistors ', ' Trypsin ', ' Tripcellim ', ' Vendor ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Businesses ', ' Dissociation ', ' fragment X ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Continuous Infusion ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' disulfide bond ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Macromolecular Complexes ', ' Macromolecular Protein Complexes ', ' Multiprotein Complexes ', ' Proteomics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' protein complex ', ' Protein Fragment ', ' Data ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Process ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' cost effective ', ' blind ', ' data acquisition ', ' encryption ', ' operation ', ' signal processing ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' electron energy ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' therapeutic marker ', ' therapeutic biomarker ', ' preservation ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' ']",NIGMS,"E-MSION, INC.",R43,2020,212830,OR-04,0.1251985908926193
"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Awarded Abstract: Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. Awarded Project Narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture. We propose to develop an HPLC-EED- MS/MS method for comprehensive glycome characterization.

"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others.

"Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because these proposed research tasks will lay the groundwork to develop a new class of algorithms and will provide rapid, high-throughput, sensitive, and reproducible and reliable tools for MS based proteomics. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics can allow systematic analysis of thousands of proteins with the promise of discovering new protein biomarkers for different disease conditions and better understanding of human systems biology. Because of high-dimensionality of the big data generated from MS machines efficient, accurate and reproducible tools are required to mine and analyze the data and is the subject of this proposal. Such high-performance tools will be instrumental in elucidating the microbiome which affects virtually all aspects of human health. Therefore, this proposal is relevant to NIH’s broader mission which support fundamental and innovative research strategies which can become the basis of protecting and improving human health.",Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data,9973317,R01GM134384,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Deductibles ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Peptides ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Galaxy ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' peptide aminoacid sequence ', ' peptide sequence ', ' protein aminoacid sequence ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' vector ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' virtual ', ' cyberinfrastructure ', ' cyber infrastructure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' protein markers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' ']",NIGMS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,322438,FL-26,0.08899209361565019
