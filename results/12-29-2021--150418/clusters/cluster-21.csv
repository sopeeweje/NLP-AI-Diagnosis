"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders. By focusing research on a mechanism that is thought to play a significant role in language acquisition, we may help to reveal potential deficits and means to identify infants who are at risk of developing lasting language problems.           Relevance The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. Benchmarks will be established to emphasize the direct competitive teasting of competing hypotheses from alternative theoretical and methodological positions.

"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             ",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7908812,F31DC009936,"['Cues ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Intention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Phase ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Morphology ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' specific language impairment ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Walking ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Competence ', ' theories ', ' model design ', ' Coupled ', ' lexical ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2010,29034,WI-02,0.17024738411151133
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,7866149,R01LM010681,"['Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electronics ', ' Caring ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' base ', ' Nitroglycerin ', ' trinitrate 1,2,3-Propanetriol ', ' Glyceryl Trinitrate ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' acronyms ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' satisfaction ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Performance ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Informatics ', ' phrases ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Documentation ', ' Communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' ']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,387500,TN-05,0.08200258037130058
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8077875,R01LM010681,"['Documentation ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Reader ', ' Computers ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Text ', ' Names ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' satisfaction ', ' Solutions ', ' Manuals ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Medical Records ', ' Caring ', ' Electronics ', ' base ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Methods ', ' Performance ', ' Records ', ' Physicians ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' insight ', ' Algorithms ', ' Time ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinical ', ' improved ', ' Provider ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' novel ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Work ', ' Technology ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Patients ', ' Detection ', ' Communication ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Individual ', ' Writing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Process ', ' Nitroglycerin ', ' trinitrate 1,2,3-Propanetriol ', ' Glyceryl Trinitrate ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Informatics ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' health record ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' phrases ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' acronyms ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' ']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,374000,TN-05,0.08200258037130058
"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.           The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           ","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",8094445,R01HD056029,"['Poaceae ', ' Grasses ', ' Gramineae ', ' Ear structure ', ' Ear ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Age-Months ', ' simulation ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Rabbits ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Behavior ', ' insight ', ' interest ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Infant ', ' Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Solutions ', ' Names ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Literature ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Visual ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Age-Years ', ' statistics ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Grant ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Resolution ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Event ', ' Data Quality ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' lexical ', ' novel ', ' Cues ', ' Time ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Attention ', ' Data ', ' Testing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Measures ', ' programs ', ' Nature ', ' Laboratories ', ' Shapes ', ' Area ', ' Structure ', ' Environment ', ' base ', ' Investigation ', ' Play ', ' social ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Process ', ' Methods ', ' Individual ', ' Goals ', ' Knowledge ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' emotional experience ', ' haptics ', ' Empirical Research ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' ']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2011,176482,IN-09,0.05338502056924215
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             ",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,8097952,F31DC009936,"['Information Distribution ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Semantics ', ' Walking ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Stream ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Competence ', ' lexical ', ' Coupled ', ' instrument ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Structure ', ' Beryllium ', ' Be element ', ' Techniques ', ' Cues ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Complex ', ' Goals ', ' Intention ', ' Elements ', ' Phase ', ' theories ', ' Infant ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Testing ', ' Knowledge ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Behavioral ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Address ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Morphology ', ' Work ', ' Process ', ' Research ', ' base ', ' Probability ', ' sound ', ' Learning ', ' Play ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' specific language impairment ', ' model design ', ' phrases ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2011,14727,WI-02,0.17024738411151133
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata.

(3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries.

"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.          This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8345041,R01LM011366,"['Age ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Information Theory ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Son ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Evaluation ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' novel ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Reporting ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Text ', ' software systems ', ' patient privacy ', ' open source ', ' efficacy testing ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2012,318849,WA-07,0.04636999383637071
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems.       This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8309015,R01GM095476,"['driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Medicine ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Hybrids ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Semantics ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Comprehension ', ' improved ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Testing ', ' Diagnostic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Collaborations ', ' Techniques ', ' Knowledge ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Genomics ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' Text ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' TREC ', ' T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles ', ' Process ', ' Validation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Address ', ' PubMed ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Retrieval ', ' Documentation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' natural language ', ' open source ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biomedical information system ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2012,179306,WI-04,0.12724319486699234
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8305149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations ', ' Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electronics ', ' trinitrate 1,2,3-Propanetriol ', ' Glyceryl Trinitrate ', ' Nitroglycerin ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' phrases ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' acronyms ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,129035,TN-05,0.08200258037130058
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.       This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8522948,F31DC013204,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Trainings ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' aphasic ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Agrammatism ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Acquired Language Disorders ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' sequence learning ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' public health relevance ', ' aphasia rehabilitation ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,34908,IL-07,0.05193109129339221

Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8474789,R01GM095476,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Semantics ', ' Testing ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' PubMed ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Retrieval ', ' TREC ', ' T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biomedical information system ', ' natural language ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2013,486484,MA-02,0.12724319486699234
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.        The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8532984,R01LM011366,"['Age ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Information Theory ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Son ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Evaluation ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' novel ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Reporting ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Text ', ' software systems ', ' patient privacy ', ' open source ', ' efficacy testing ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,247288,WA-07,0.04636999383637071
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.                ",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8811565,R01LM011934,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dictionary ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Interest Group ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Metric ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2014,460688,MN-01,0.09617628242025306
"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Medical Record (EMR), discharge summaries, and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" BioNLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EMRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to automatically extract adverse drug event from the Electronic Medical Record.

"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.                ",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,8714196,F32HD080306,"['thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive system ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' stimulus processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2014,57782,MD-05,0.13805234244762205
"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8642022,F31DC013204,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Trainings ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' aphasic ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Agrammatism ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Acquired Language Disorders ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' sequence learning ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' public health relevance ', ' aphasia rehabilitation ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning ability ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,35352,IL-07,0.05193109129339221
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.        The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8722030,R01LM011366,"['Age ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Information Theory ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Son ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Evaluation ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' novel ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Reporting ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Text ', ' software systems ', ' patient privacy ', ' open source ', ' efficacy testing ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,260727,WA-07,0.04636999383637071
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8669161,R00LM010943,"['abstracting ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Terminology ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Librarians ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Metadata ', ' systematic review ', ' vector ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' screening ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2014,212994,PA-18,0.05852156551677225
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,8633838,K99LM011575,"['Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Computers ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' portability ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2014,96232,MN-01,0.049856654472378664
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3.             Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,8818096,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Names ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' National Library of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Solutions ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,558372,TX-09,0.10299422074172386
"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8734439,R01GM095476,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Semantics ', ' Testing ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' PubMed ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Retrieval ', ' TREC ', ' T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biomedical information system ', ' natural language ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2014,489755,MA-02,0.12724319486699234
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The acquisition of language is essential for normal functioning, and problems with language acquisition can severely limit an individual's educational, career, and social opportunities. One mechanism thought to play a critical role in language acquisition is statistical learning, which refers to the process of extracting subtle patterns from environmental input. Although it is commonly assumed that statistical learning operates implicitly, without requiring conscious effort or awareness, this fundamental assumption has not been directly tested. It is possible that inducing statistical learning to occur explicitly rather than implicitly may engage additional explicit memory systems and may also facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation processes that are critical for long-term retention. The goal of the proposed research is to assess whether and how learning mode alters the memory systems and sleep-dependent consolidation processes that support statistical learning.  In the first proposed study, the effect of learning mode on the memory systems recruited for statistical learning will be evaluated, using a combination of behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses. In the second proposed study, the effect of learning mode on sleep-dependent consolidation of statistical representations will be assessed, using a combination of behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. Because patients often show dissociations of implicit and explicit memory, understanding how learning mode may modulate the memory systems and subsequent sleep-dependent consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning could have tremendous potential to inform treatments for language disorders. For example, by manipulating learning mode, therapies may be developed to selectively target one memory system in order to compensate for dysfunctions in the other, or to promote sleep-dependent consolidation.  The proposed fellowship training will provide instruction in two main methodological areas: (1) sleep neurobiology and (2) fMRI analyses. Training in these two different areas will be integrated by the common goal of understanding how learning mode alters the memory systems and consolidation processes that support statistical learning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Difficulties with language acquisition are characteristic of a wide range of disorders, such as specific language impairment and autism, and present a major barrier to normal functioning. Statistical learning, the process of extracting complex patterns from the environment, is thought to play a critical role in language acquisition, with deficits in statistical learning potentially contributing to language-related disorders. The current proposal aims to understand how learning mode influences the memory and consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning and may ultimately inform treatments for those with language-related disorders.                ","Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation",8979446,F32HD078223,"[""Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Awareness ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Cerebellum ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Cues ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Environment ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Memory ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sleep ', ' Speech ', ' temporal lobe/cortex ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Dissociation ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' implicit memory ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' memory retrieval ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Napping ', ' response ', ' Complex Extracts ', ' Crude Extracts ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' public health relevance ', ' operation ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,54194,IL-07,0.06140195951069025
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment. The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.",Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development,8852664,R01HD067364,"['Affect ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Israel ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Assimilations ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' orthographical ', ' orthographic ', ' Orthography ', ' theories ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Reader ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' brain behavior ', ' neural patterning ', ' longitudinal design ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning ability ', ' ']",NICHD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R01,2015,576358,CT-03,0.15564715240414337
"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.                ",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,8850708,F32HD080306,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive system ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' stimulus processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2015,60542,MD-05,0.13805234244762205
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8928647,R01LM011934,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dictionary ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Interest Group ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' ']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,376327,MN-01,0.09617628242025306
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.            ",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,8942806,R01HS024090,[''],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,232521,MA-07,0.09281704199423989
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.","Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys",8851635,R01HD067250,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Cues ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Football ', ' Manufactured football ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Parents ', ' Phonetics ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Tamarins ', ' Saguinus ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Soccer ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Stimulus ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Recovery ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Rivers ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Head Movements ', ' Hour ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' British ', ' Performance ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Sum ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' lexical ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2015,208800,PA-12,0.07943556761289962
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,8787131,R01HD051698,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Phonetics ', ' Records ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' sound ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Stuttering ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' bilingualism ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' XML ', ' Extensible Markup Language ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' ']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,268514,PA-18,0.13888319814996145
"EMR Adverse Drug Event Detection for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse drug events (ADEs) result in substantial patient morbidity and lead to over 100,000 deaths yearly. The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cancer drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Medical Record (EMR), discharge summaries, and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" BioNLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EMRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries.

These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9255906,F31DC015370,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' farmer ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' natural language ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' comprehension deficit ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2016,31612,IA-02,0.12125020192006657
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9222109,R21HS024977,[''],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,137233,OH-01,0.04736520615379577
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9172394,R01DC015642,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' cleaved ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 3 year old ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,606922,AZ-03,0.07917748336724145
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biology ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Medical ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' Applaud ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' precision medicine ', ' health data ', ' clinical investigation ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' neuropsychiatric symptom ', ' terabyte ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,MA-08,0.11497201942869088

"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,9116243,F32HD080306,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Address ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cognitive system ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' stimulus processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2016,60210,MD-05,0.13805234244762205

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9187058,R00LM011575,"['Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Computers ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' portability ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2016,251021,MA-08,0.049856654472378664
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9115996,R01LM011934,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Interest Group ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' query optimization ', ' optimizing queries ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' ']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,387966,MN-01,0.09617628242025306
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9132834,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Names ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' real world application ', ' model building ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,463405,TX-09,0.10299422074172386
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.                ",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9020029,R01DC013996,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Tests ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Only Child ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Production ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' American Sign Language ', ' Sign Language ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,638494,OR-03,0.11747154686399967
"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR).

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9116242,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' Noise ', ' Phonetics ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' theories ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,263788,TN-02,0.11436682232281015
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9115065,R01HS024090,[''],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,227891,MA-07,0.09281704199423989
"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.        ","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9112198,R03HD084941,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Controlled Vocabulary ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' heuristics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' developmental psychology ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' word learning ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' Learning Skill ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2016,78438,CA-03,0.13367947562843785
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,8984169,R01HD051698,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' apraxia ', ' Dyspraxia ', ' Apraxias ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Phonetics ', ' Records ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' sound ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Stammering ', ' Stuttering ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' XML ', ' Extensible Markup Language ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' Discourse analysis ', ' Conversation analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,270581,PA-18,0.13888319814996145
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR).

It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9297279,R01DC015642,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,606922,AZ-03,0.07917748336724145
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9275946,R01HS024090,[''],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,227900,MA-07,0.09281704199423989
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9191358,R01DC013996,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Tests ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' American Sign Language ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,602469,OR-03,0.11747154686399967
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9355161,R21HS024977,[''],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,159334,OH-01,0.04736520615379577
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9313700,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Memory ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' theories ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,267749,TN-02,0.11436682232281015
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9337267,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Names ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' Face Processing ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' real world application ', ' word learning ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,463061,TX-09,0.10299422074172386
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9352674,F31DC015370,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' farmer ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' natural language ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' comprehension deficit ', ' language impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2017,24909,IA-02,0.12125020192006657
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9325065,R01LM011934,"['Adoption ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Interest Group ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' information model ', ' query optimization ', ' optimizing queries ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' ']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,387966,MN-01,0.09617628242025306
"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9242682,R03HD084941,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cues ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Controlled Vocabulary ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' heuristics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' developmental psychology ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' word learning ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' Learning Skill ', ' language impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2017,78500,CA-03,0.13367947562843785
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults.

"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9506574,R01DC015642,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Special Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' 3 year old ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,606922,AZ-03,0.07917748336724145
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9505570,K23HL141639,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Policy Research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' discrete data ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Patient risk ', ' trial design ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2018,195205,PA-03,0.0037914835451952275
"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.    ",Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants,9445282,R21DC016069,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' auditory pathway ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Language ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Michigan ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Cochlear implant procedure ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Cochlear Implantation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' auditory deprivation ', ' sound deprivation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Surgical Management ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 4 year old ', ' neural model ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' cognitive ability ', ' individual patient ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' individualized management ', ' personalized management ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' preservation ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' ']",NIDCD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,245338,IL-07,0.03189527190307963
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern.

In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9390046,R01DC013996,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Tests ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' American Sign Language ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,578454,OR-03,0.11747154686399967
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9579181,R01LM012918,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conceptions ', ' Data Sources ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' case finding ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' software systems ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' natural language ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' social media ', ' Apache ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,416066,MA-07,0.10380023036405722
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9471944,R01HD037082,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' lexical ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594063,DC-98,0.1283145852890192
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.

"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9481256,R01HS024090,[''],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,227899,MA-07,0.09281704199423989
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia.

"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Medical Education ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Gastroesophageal reflux disease ', ' Gastroesophageal Reflux ', ' Gastro-oesophageal Reflux ', ' GERD ', ' Esophageal Reflux ', ' Acid Reflux ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Triage ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Medication Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' care delivery ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' performance tests ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,MA-07,0.047339367551979344
"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9479293,R00LM012104,"['abstracting ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Award ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' illiterate ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' information organization ', ' knowledge representation ', ' frame-based representation ', ' computer-based representation ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' open source ', ' lexical ', ' prototype ', ' electronic structure ', ' natural language ', ' operation ', ' health data ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' data access ', ' patient portal ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2018,248999,TX-09,0.12176430721241398
"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9543557,R01LM012592,"['Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Burn injury ', ' burned ', ' Burns ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gel ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Paper ', ' Privatization ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' European ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' repository ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Co-Immunoprecipitations ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Protein Structure Initiative ', ' PSI ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Source Code ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' data modeling ', ' software systems ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' optical character recognition ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,264277,CA-37,0.045324351285687424
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9534183,R01LM011934,"['Adoption ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Information Retrieval Systems ', ' Interest Group ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' information model ', ' optimizing queries ', ' query optimization ', ' patient profile ', ' profiles in patients ', ' ']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,387966,MN-01,0.09617628242025306
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9600692,R01DC013996,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Tests ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' screening ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' American Sign Language ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,568221,OR-03,0.11747154686399967
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases.

"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive.

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9757857,F32DC017637,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus Caudatus ', ' caudate nucleus ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Control Groups ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Patients ', ' putamen ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Stammering ', ' Stuttering ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' interest ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' social ', ' Developmental Stuttering ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Speech Development ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' motor control ', ' standardize measure ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' neural patterning ', ' neural correlate ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2019,65354,,-0.027736434219168368
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9729661,R01DC015642,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Therapy ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Procedures ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' economic outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,606922,AZ-03,0.07917748336724145
"An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed project is to examine the feasibility of an individualized vocabulary intervention program for preschool dual language learners (DLL) from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Children who grow up in low SES and language minority homes (L1) and learn English (L2) as a second language in school settings are likely to be at risk for reading difficulties and poor academic performance (e.g., August et al., 2006). In order to serve the particular needs of DLLs from diverse backgrounds, scientific evidence is critically needed about the intervention strategies for these preschoolers. In this proposed study, we examine the feasibility of using machine learning methods to generate individually tailored interventions for low SES dual language learners who learn two typologically different languages, Cantonese (L1) and English (L2). Two important strategies will be used in this study. First, a computation model will be built to predict and select appropriate bilingual target words for individual DLLs. Second, this intervention will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps. There are two specific aims in this proposed study: 1. Model normative lexical development in Cantonese-English DLLs. We will leverage  data previously collected by Dr. Kan on Cantonese-English vocabulary development at  Head Start Centers, and computational models of typical lexical development in monolingual  English speakers, to build a computational model of typical bilingual lexical development in  Cantonese-English dual language learners. 2. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a model-based individualized vocabulary  intervention program. We will use the computational model to make individual level target  word recommendations for 200 Cantonese-English DLLs, and work with teachers at 8 Head  Start centers to integrate the recommendations into their existing curriculum. The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine learning methods to develop an individualized, personalized vocabulary intervention programs for preschool dual language learners from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9768545,R01LM012918,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conceptions ', ' Data Sources ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Research ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Measurement ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' case finding ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Output ', ' software systems ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' natural language ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' social media ', ' Apache ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,383874,MA-07,0.10380023036405722
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9731439,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communication impairment ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career networking ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2019,39939,MA-07,-0.009092326540495925
"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan.     Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.    ",Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants,9733185,R21DC016069,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' auditory pathway ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Michigan ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Cochlear implant procedure ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Cochlear Implantation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' auditory deprivation ', ' sound deprivation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Surgical Management ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Characteristics ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 4 year old ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' neural model ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' cognitive ability ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' personalized management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' individualized management ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' preservation ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' deaf ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' deafened ', ' normal hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R21,2019,173098,IL-07,0.03189527190307963
"Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction Project Summary/Abstract Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain significant information that can benefit many downstream uses. However, most of this information is in unstructured narrative form and is inaccessible to computerized methods that rely on structured representations for exploring, retrieving, and presenting the information. Natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) open this trove of information to studies that would otherwise be without. Over the past decades, many IE systems have been developed. These systems have typically focused on one task at a time. In addition, most have studied only specific types of records, e.g., discharge summaries, and addressed their task on data from a single institution. Performances achieved by the state-of-the-art IE systems developed under these conditions ranged from 44% F-measure to 99% F-measure. This observed variation can be attributed to the nature of the tasks: some target entities like dates tend to be better represented in the data and also more rigidly stick to known patterns of expression as opposed to reasons for medication administration which are relatively sparse in the data and can show wider linguistic diversity. However, this may not be the only reason: the data used can also explain the performance variation. Narratives of EHRs vary in their style, format, and content going from one department to another, from one hospital to another. Even the same record type in two different hospitals can be very different in narrative style and pose different challenges for IE. Understanding IE performance therefore requires studies of multiple tasks on multiple record types that come from multiple institutions. One major bottleneck for evaluation of IE systems on such a large scale is annotation. The same bottleneck also limits system development. This proposal aims to address this bottleneck for both evaluation and development. It first generates a multi-institution corpus consisting of multiple record types from five institutions. It studies four different IE tasks that broadly represent IE in clinical records and can inform the field of IE as a whole: de-identification, clinical concept extraction, medication extraction, and adverse drug event extraction. Within the context of these IE tasks, the proposal then puts forward methods that learn from unlabeled or pseudo data that can help alleviate reliance on annotated data for development. It evaluates these methods both for performance and generalizability on multiple types of records from multiple institutions. As a result of these activities, this proposal generates de-identified data, annotations, methods, software, and machine learning models which it then makes available to the research community. Project Narrative Information extraction (IE) systems, i.e., natural language processing (NLP) systems that enable creation of accurate semantic representations of narratives, rely heavily on the availability of gold standard annotated corpora and vary significantly in their performance from task to task, and from data set to data set. We propose methods that augment gold standard data with unlabeled data that are more easily available, and pseudo data which can be derived from gold standard data. We study IE within the context of four tasks and evaluate IE systems enhanced with unlabeled and pseudo data for generalizability on a heterogeneous data set consisting of multiple record types from five institutions.",Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction,9813134,R15LM013209,"['Affect ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Gold ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hospitals ', ' Israel ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Task Performances ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' dosage ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Medical center ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' Systems Development ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' medication administration ', ' deep learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414798,VA-11,0.0722679969128091
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9681485,K23HL141639,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' TimeLine ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Policy Research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' discrete data ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' supportive environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,195076,PA-03,0.0037914835451952275
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9607105,R01HD037082,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Infant ', ' Information Distribution ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' lexical ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' deaf ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' deafened ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,580188,DC-98,0.1283145852890192
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading.

"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9753018,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' longterm memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' theories ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,268205,TN-02,0.11436682232281015
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis,9613837,R01HD051698,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Apraxias ', ' apraxia ', ' Dyspraxia ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Stammering ', ' Stuttering ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protocol development ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Extensible Markup Language ', ' XML ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,268961,PA-18,0.12927154314478967
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth.

"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Medical Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gastroesophageal Reflux ', ' Gastro-oesophageal Reflux ', ' GERD ', ' Esophageal Reflux ', ' Acid Reflux ', ' Gastroesophageal reflux disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' New York City ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Triage ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' care delivery ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' performance tests ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' minority communities ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,MA-07,0.047339367551979344
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9788034,F32DC017373,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' farmer ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' language processing ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2019,22217,AZ-03,0.05714609338053099
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces Project Summary Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to transform communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease through personalized and real-time augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Individuals with severe communication impairments who can no longer control their daily conversations or participate in previous life roles want AAC devices. And they want them to work – to be reliable, effective, and fast. ML and NLP are emerging as promising tools to bridge current technology and next generation devices for individuals with the most severe speech and physical impairments, like the RSVP Keyboard™, a brain-computer interface (BCI) being developed by the parent grant. BCI systems for communication are referred to as AAC-BCIs. NLP efforts to combine large public data sets with private data sets, such as personal email messages, promise to give individuals with communication impairments their own personalized language models, models that are sufficiently robust to get closer to real-time communication. The focus on getting AAC-BCIs to work with machine learning, however, has led to a critical oversight in the field: an inadequate understanding of why individuals want next-generation devices and what trade-offs they are willing to make for faster and more personalized communication. The turn to ML brings this oversight into sharp relief. Individuals should provide input about the data sets used to construct their personal language models, but this raises important ethical questions about what individuals value, how they understand their identity, and what trade-offs they are willing to make relative to their personalized communication data. The goal of this supplement is to fill this gap in understanding so that researchers can implement ML into next generation AAC-BCI systems in a way that is sensitive to the ethical concerns of future users. There are four components to this ethics supplement: (1) to design a toolbox of ethics vignettes tailored to ethical concerns raised by both BCI communication and ML; (2) to administer monthly vignette-based online ethics surveys to individuals with severe communication impairments due to motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS) (n=25) or movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) (n=25); (3) to conduct semi-structured vignette-based interviews with individuals with pre- clinical or mild communication impairment due to motor neuron disease (n=10) or movement disorder (n=10). Components (2) and (3) will employ an iterative, parallel mixed-method approach. Trends in Likert-style online responses to ethics vignettes in the severe communication impairment cohort will be used to inform and modify the semi-structured interview prompts asked of the pre-clinical or mild impairment cohort. In parallel, themes emerging from direct content analysis of interviews will be used to refine online survey questions. Results of this iterative, mix-methods approach will be used (4) to outline a framework of core ethical domains and preliminary tools (vignettes and discussion prompts) that AAC-BCI researchers can use to assess ethical concerns while developing and iteratively refining communication technology for personalized language models. Project Narrative The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies.

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9642922,R01LM012973,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Israel ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Records ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Training Technique ', ' Training Technics ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' novel ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Human Nature ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' data resource ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' neural network ', ' machine translation ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,386910,MA-07,-0.03136648651762915
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3.

"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3.

"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9836112,F31DC018220,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Connecticut ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Endowment ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Logic ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Word Processing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' phonology ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' clinical risk ', ' neural correlate ', ' word learning ', ' improved outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Grain ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2019,40450,CT-02,0.13484472649039783
"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used

"Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) PROJECT SUMMARY – Original Submission Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Although language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here 24-36 months) impedes accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model to identify PLI as early as possible. Our developmentally- sensitive, translational approach introduces multiple innovations including: (1) characterizing the developmental patterning of toddler emergent language beginning at 24 mos. using state-of-the-art methods, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language into PLI risk assessment; (3) using a novel paradigm to assess the protective effects of both behavioral and neural synchronization within parent-child language transactions; and (4) consideration of irritability, a robust developmental marker of early mental health risk, to enhance identification of those language delayed toddlers at highest risk for persistence. For the proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L), we capitalize on our funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non-irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24-month-olds. Our key predictors will be toddler emergent language patterns (24-36 months), their neural biomarkers and synchrony within the transactional language environment. Our central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age (54 mos., when PLI can be reliably evaluated), assessed via clinical gold standard expressive and receptive language abilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1a. Evaluate accuracy of PLI prediction based on multi-component measures of language including intensive longitudinal assessments of toddler developmental precursors of key language functions at older ages, neural biomarkers. We will assess neural and linguistic processing via quantitative EEG during parent-child interaction and ERPs to speech sounds as well as during eye tracking tasks and 1b. Evaluate feasibility of creating an algorithm for early identification of PLI that can be applied in clinical practice, using cross-validation and machine learning. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that parent-child dyadic synchrony buffers PLI risk For the first time, we combine behavioral and novel social EEG measures of parent-child synchrony during natural interaction and a custom-designed word learning task to directly test how observed (behavioral) and neural (EEG) dyadic synchrony impact word learning. AIM 3: Test whether consideration of toddler irritability enhances PLI prediction. In sum, PLI confers sustained negative effects on a variety of personal-social and academic outcomes. Pinpointing children at highest risk for PLI is critical for reducing the public health burden of PLI for children, families, and the systems supporting them, and enhancing targeted allocation of resources. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, many toddlers with early language delays recover naturally, and others who appear to be developing typically show signs of impairment by preschool age. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, multi-level neurodevelopmental approach to characterize emergent language patterns from 24- 36 mos. along with the influence of neural and linguistic processing and transactional processes within the child's broader language environment. We also test whether PLI prediction is enhanced via consideration of irritability, a robust predictor of early mental health risk. Drawing on findings from our predictive models, we will also examine feasibility of developing a clinical algorithm from this scientifically-validated toolkit. Generating reliable methods for accurate identification of young children at highest risk for language impairment lays the foundation for optimizing early intervention and preventing developmentally-cascading effects on academic and adaptive functioning.",Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L),10162280,R01DC016273,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Buffers ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Language ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Illinois ', ' Infant ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Transact ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Interruption ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' protective effect ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' high risk ', ' standard measure ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' word learning ', ' language impairment ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' stress reduction ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,197084,IL-07,0.16161353187202473
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Language ', ' language training ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Licensing ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercialization ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' model building ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' clinical database ', ' FHIR ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' ']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,TX-09,0.11449802145248335
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading.

"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Services ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' cognitive function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Study Subject ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' demographics ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' primary care setting ', ' electronic structure ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' risk mitigation ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' treatment choice ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' testing services ', ' insurance claims ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Data Scientist ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' adverse event risk ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' feature extraction ', ' learning classifier ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,NY-13,0.02052304716584792
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9906933,K23HL141639,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' TimeLine ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Policy Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' discrete data ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' trial design ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' supportive environment ', ' risk prediction model ', ' statistical learning ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' clinical encounter ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,194806,PA-03,0.0037914835451952275
"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives. This will have important relevance for basic neuroscience, clinical pathophysiology, and the development of future therapeutics for cognitive impairments.",Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge,9906282,K23NS110920,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' memory retrieval ', ' Participant ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' natural language ', ' neuroethics ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' signal processing ', ' brain circuitry ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,200178,CA-12,0.05834720627692281
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9868326,R01LM012973,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Israel ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' data resource ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' neural network ', ' machine translation ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,367184,MA-07,-0.03136648651762915
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal

"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Visual ', ' Letters ', ' journal article ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Computer Based Patient Record ', ' Electronic patient record ', ' Electronic-based patient record ', ' Computerized Patient Records ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Proteomics ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Text ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' prototype ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' dynamical evolution ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' pharmacovigilance ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,CO-06,0.04023817292813447
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9825536,R01DC013996,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Language Tests ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Voice ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' language disorder diagnosis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' school district ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' American Sign Language ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,574747,OR-03,0.11747154686399967
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9986899,R01LM012918,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conceptions ', ' Data Sources ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' case finding ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' software systems ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' natural language ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' social media ', ' Apache ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' neural network ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' side effect ', ' structured data ', ' adaptation algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,383874,MA-07,0.10380023036405722
"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9983144,R01LM012592,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' burned ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gel ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Paper ', ' Privatization ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Work ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' European ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Co-Immunoprecipitations ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' PSI ', ' Protein Structure Initiative ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Source Code ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' software systems ', ' Consumption ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' optical character recognition ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Grain ', ' structured data ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,264232,CA-37,0.045324351285687424
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,9906653,F31MD014941,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Client ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Empathy ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' cultural competence ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' commercial application ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' sexual identity ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2020,45016,UT-02,0.05048299851452076
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9944309,F32DC017637,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' caudate nucleus ', ' Nucleus Caudatus ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Control Groups ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Patients ', ' putamen ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Stuttering ', ' Stammering ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' specific language impairment ', ' interest ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' economic impact ', ' Reporting ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' social ', ' Developmental Stuttering ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Speech Development ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' motor control ', ' standardize measure ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' neural patterning ', ' neural correlate ', ' language impairment ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2020,69426,,-0.027736434219168368
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used

"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Awareness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Medication Errors ', ' medication administration errors ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Services ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Management ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' home healthcare agencies ', ' Home Health Care Agencies ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Medicare claim ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' study population ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' unstructured data ', "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,NY-12,-0.015648322442854242
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10197509,R00LM013001,"['Award ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' North America ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resort ', ' Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' impression ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Nomenclature ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' lexical ', ' Systems Development ', ' Data Science ', ' Formulation ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' long short term memory ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' knowledge graph ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2020,236549,NY-12,0.054218744253881256
"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9975626,F31DC018220,"['multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' clinical risk ', ' neural correlate ', ' word learning ', ' improved outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Grain ', ' language outcome ', ' support vector machine ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Connecticut ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Endowment ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Logic ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Word Processing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Early Intervention ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' phonology ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' 3 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2020,15602,CT-02,0.13484472649039783
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9875268,R01DC016273,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Infant ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family history of ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' model building ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,585545,IL-07,0.18476927098483217
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9873880,R01AG060993,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alabama ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Descriptor ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' phrases ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' validation studies ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' model development ', ' Ally ', ' Provider ', ' ward ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' elder care ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' functional decline ', ' virtual ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' screening ', ' confusion assessment method ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care costs ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' acute care ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,376860,AL-07,0.010356983592077786
"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,9957898,R21EB029575,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Encephalomalacia ', ' Cerebromalacia ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Goals ', ' Hemosiderin ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Liver neoplasms ', ' Hepatic Neoplasms ', ' hepatic neoplasia ', ' hepatic neoplasm ', ' hepatic tumor ', ' liver tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' CXR ', ' chest X ray ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest radiography ', ' lung radiography ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' thorax radiography ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' lateral ventricle ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' spatial relationship ', ' tumor ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' radiological imaging ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,271250,TX-09,0.03788749534823175
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly

"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10066805,F32HL151181,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' ICD-10 ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' Provider ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' claudication ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,82476,NC-04,0.08901488362519608
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.
