"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           ",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis. The proposed technique has significant clinical potentials in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment as well.          ",A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis,7841805,R01CA115320,"['Cytogenetics ', ' Skin ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Deletion Mutation ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Scheme ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Custom ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Microscopic ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' leukemia ', ' Blood (Leukemia) ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Metaphase ', ' Mitotic Metaphase ', ' Methods ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Physicians ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Cultured Tumor Cells ', ' Cultured Neoplastic Cells ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Chromosome Pairing ', ' Synapsis ', ' Chromosomal Synapsis ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' S-Phase Fraction ', ' Proliferation Index ', ' Mitotic Index ', ' Cellular Proliferation Rate ', ' Cell Proliferative Activity ', ' Chromosome abnormality ', ' Cytogenetic Abnormalities ', ' Cytogenetic Aberrations ', ' Chromosome Anomalies ', ' Chromosome Alterations ', ' Chromosome Aberrations ', ' Chromosomal Alterations ', ' Chromosomal Abnormalities ', ' Chromosomal Aberrations ', ' Aberrant Chromosome ', ' Congenital chromosomal disease ', ' Chromosome Disorders ', ' Chromosome Abnormality Disorders ', ' Chromosomal Disorders ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3 ', ' Chromosome 3 ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' computerized ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2010,313901,OK-04,-0.02252246674023428
"Optimizing Peripheral Nerve Regeneration using Computational Intelligence based T    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Peripheral nerve injuries are common diseases that affect a large amount of patients every year.  Tissue engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for developing alternative nerve grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration.  Since tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration involve various possible combinations of variables, it is necessary to develop efficient tools to identify optimal tissue engineering strategies and predict the experimental results based on these tissue engineering strategies for peripheral nerve regeneration.  Some research groups have applied artificial neural networks and decision trees to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies.  For the decision trees based methods, it is hard to tell which classification tree is better than the other.  Furthermore, the prediction system using the decision tree algorithm lacks the capability of accumulating the learning experience over time.  On the other hand, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibit some remarkable properties, but only the connection weights are trained with fixed topology.  It is hard to find the best fixed topology in advance for each specific tissue engineering strategy.  In this proposal, swarm intelligence (SI) based evolving ANNs technique is proposed to tackle this challenge.  Two swarm intelligence based methods, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), will be applied in this project to train the ANN model.  More specifically, ACO will be used to optimize the topology structure of the ANN models, while the PSO is used to adjust the connection weights of the ANN models based on the optimized topology structure.  For this SWarm Intelligence based Reinforcement Learning method for ANNs (SWIRL-ANN) system, both topology and connection weight of artificial neural networks can be evolved automatically and simultaneously so that an optimal classifier for tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration can be achieved.  The research project will include the following phases:  Aim 1:  Predict tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration using SWarm Intelligence based Reinforcement Learning method for ANNs (SWIRL-ANN) analytical and prediction system.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8477880,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Papilledema ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disability burden ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,339750,IA-02,0.027112006844787036
"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.         In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints. The technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Couples ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Negatrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Electrons ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hybrids ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Microscopy, Electron, Scanning ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Names ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Organelles ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Stains ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Neuropil ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' electron optics ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Intracellular Structure ', ' Subcellular structure ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Resolution ', ' Computer Instrumentation ', ' Advanced Instrumentation ', ' Computers and Advanced Instrumentation ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' web interface ', ' scientific computing ', ' prototype ', ' biological systems ', ' complex biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,CA-52,0.034699879478928594
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8652462,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Papilledema ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disability burden ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2014,332955,IA-02,0.027112006844787036
"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow.

"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit  temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8757781,R21CA187877,"['Accounting ', ' abdominal aorta ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Colon ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Kinetics ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Play ', ' wave (radiation) ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Cost Savings ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Therapeutic ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tumor Angiogenesis ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2014,227070,MA-08,-0.052849339263948567
"Image-guided planning system for skull correction in children with craniosynostos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures and occurs in approximately one in 2000 live births. It results in cranial malformation that can lead to elevated intra-cranial pressure, brain growth impairment, and developmental deficiency. The most common treatment option for craniosynostosis is surgery. Currently, surgical treatment planning of craniosynostosis is mostly qualitative, subjective and irreproducible guided mainly by the surgeon's experience. While virtual planning has been successfully introduced in niche areas of craniofacial surgery, such as corrective jaw surgery applications, clinical tools that provide accurate and reproducible evaluation of cranial morphology to guide cranial vault remodeling do not yet exist. To cover this gap in current clinical practice, we will develop personalized preoperative planning for infants with craniosynostosis that allows for decreased operative time and blood loss, thereby reducing perioperative morbidity, but also facilitates an optimized and more durable long-term outcome.  In this Phase I STTR project, our goal is to design, develop and validate a virtual surgery system for optimal treatment planning for cranial remodeling. The plan includes creating a normative multi-atlas database to capture a wide breadth of normal variations on cranial shape and patient ages, developing image processing and statistical shape analysis algorithms to identify desirable post-operative skull shapes, and analyzing biomechanical properties of cranial bones to evaluate osteotomy plans. The surgeon will be presented with a visual and quantitative map of the patient's cranial malformations, the desired post-treatment cranial shape, and a personalized plan of how cranial shape should be altered in the least invasive fashion to most accurately approach the normal head shape. The impact of our technology is reduced perioperative morbidity and lower treatment costs. The technology will also enable the precise, quantitative comparison of measurements before and after cranial vault reconstruction to determine the efficacy and durability of specific reconstructive techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures and occurs in approximately one in 2000 live births.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8842639,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Papilledema ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disability burden ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2015,332955,IA-02,0.027112006844787036
"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8893927,R21CA187877,"['Accounting ', ' abdominal aorta ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Colon ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Kinetics ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Play ', ' wave (radiation) ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Cost Savings ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Therapeutic ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Tumor Angiogenesis ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2015,189225,MA-08,-0.052849339263948567
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Family ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Image Reconstructions ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Training ', ' Letters ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Resolution ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,NY-26,-0.00747769684004279
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians.  Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9186673,R01CA206100,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Normal Distribution ', ' Gaussian Distribution ', ' Normal Statistical Distribution ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Physicians ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Rectum ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Sample Size ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment duration ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' IGRT ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,347254,NC-04,-0.0701485067333261
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9213205,R01NS099061,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' apraxia ', ' Dyspraxia ', ' Apraxias ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cheese ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Supramarginal Gyrus ', ' Structure of supramarginal gyrus ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' ']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2016,431274,PA-02,-0.01940405930227154
"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project.

This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas.

The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9050682,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Papilledema ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' disability burden ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2016,339750,IA-02,0.027112006844787036
"Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9336855,R01CA206100,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Normal Statistical Distribution ', ' Normal Distribution ', ' Gaussian Distribution ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Physicians ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Rectum ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Sample Size ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' IGRT ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,347700,NC-04,-0.0701485067333261
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9336000,R01NS099061,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' apraxia ', ' Dyspraxia ', ' Apraxias ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cheese ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Supramarginal Gyrus ', ' Structure of supramarginal gyrus ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' treatment strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2017,418122,PA-02,-0.01940405930227154
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9258847,F31CA214029,"['Archives

"Graph-Based Medical Image Segmentation in 3D and 4D DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive continuation of our Phase-II project. After successfully fulfilling all of its aims, our framework for optimal multi-surface andor multi-object n-D biomedical image segmentation was further extended, validated, and its practical utility demonstrated in clinical and translational image analysis tasks. This Phase-III proposal will develop several important extensions addressing identified limitations of the current framework and specifically focusing on applicability of the methodology to translational and routine healthcare tasks. Novel methods will be developed for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions and surfaces, automated design of cost functions from segmentation examples, and overcoming failures of automated techniques in routine diagnostic quality images by allowing limited and highly efficient expert input to guide the image segmentation processes.  We hypothesize that advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms merging machine- learning-derived segmentation parameters and image-specific expert guidance will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. We propose to: 1) Develop 3D, 4D, and generally n-D approaches for simultaneous segmentation of mutually interacting regions (objects) and surfaces. 2) Develop methods for data-driven automated design of cost functions used for surface-based, region-based, and surface-and-region-based graph search image segmentation. 3) Develop ""Just-Enough-Interaction"" (JEI) approaches for efficient ""real-time"" medical image segmentation, thus achieving robust clinical applicability of quantitative medical image analysis. 4) Assess performance of all developed methods in translational research settings; determine performance in quantitative medical image analysis and radiation oncology treatment planning workflow.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris�n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris�n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9264531,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' Papilledema ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' raised intracranial pressure ', ' raised ICP ', ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' Funduscopes ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' optic imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' disability burden ', ' public health relevance ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,339750,IA-02,0.027112006844787036
"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9251317,R21HL131385,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ammonia ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Cyclotrons ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' implantable device ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Investments ', ' Kinetics ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rubidium ', ' Rb element ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' glucose transport ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' Blood flow ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' Performance ', ' radiotracer ', ' radiolabel ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' 18FDG ', ' Myocardial tissue ', ' Heart Muscle tissue ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Tracer ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' ischemic cardiomyopathy ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,195625,CA-03,-0.01394149025895648
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysplasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to develop a based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for identification of regions at risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the esophagus. EAC is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%; yet the standard of care for detecting precursors to EAC is widely recognized to be inadequate. Just recently, a study found that 25% of patients who underwent a standard endoscopic surveillance exam which was found to be ‘clear’ then went on and progressed to EAC within one year. Clearly today’s approach is not working and a significant percentage of disease is being missed. While comprehensive esophageal OCT imaging has shown great potential in addressing this unmet clinical need, one of the main limiters to wider adoption and impact of this technology is the challenge of interpreting the large volume of high-resolution images in real-time. A CAD algorithm would allow OCT to realize its promise in this field and significantly improve the standard of care. Here we propose the development of a deep learning CAD algorithm which will operate on a full patient level volumetric dataset with awareness of the anatomy, robust against image quality and motion artifacts, and trained and validated against a large dataset (>1000 patients).

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9518217,R01HL142036,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' aortic valve ', ' aortic valve replacement ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' ascending aorta ', ' Attention ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Engineering ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Extravasation ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Valves ', ' Cardiac Valves ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mitral Valve ', ' Bicuspid Valve ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Stents ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' Translations ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Device Designs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Coronary Occlusions ', ' heart occlusion ', ' cardiac occlusion ', ' Guidelines ', ' Calcified ', ' calcification ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' function of the heart ', ' cardiac function ', ' heart function ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' time resolved data ', ' Response Elements ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' Geometry ', ' Homework Exercises ', ' Problem Sets ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' virtual clinical trial ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical imaging ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,392932,GA-05,-0.010666631410297263
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' corneal transplant ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pathological Dilatation ', ' Pathologic Dilatation ', ' Ectasia ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Family suidae ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Visual impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' vision impairment ', ' impaired vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' cross-link ', ' crosslink ', ' Procedures ', ' incision ', ' Otomy ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Laser In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser-Assisted Stromal In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileuses ', ' LASIK ', ' Property ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Torsion ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Hydration status ', ' Hydration ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Patient risk ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' mechanical properties ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' first in man ', ' first-in-human ', ' ']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,OH-11,0.01401766424520405
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9527787,R01CA206100,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Normal Statistical Distribution ', ' Normal Distribution ', ' Gaussian Distribution ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Physicians ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Rectum ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Sample Size ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' IGRT ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,347700,NC-04,-0.0701485067333261
"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' radiologist ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Reader ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Step retraining ', ' Step training ', ' prospective ', ' data acquisition ', ' data space ', ' patient population ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,NY-12,0.024084764318451
"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology

"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning,9692133,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Probability ', ' Pupil ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Arbitration ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Competence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' source guides ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' fictional works ', ' fiction ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,429555,CT-03,0.002638080845468625
"Deep Learning in the context of Multispectral optoacoustic tomography Administrative supplement ABSTRACT for Administrative Supplement: Current methods identified at late to identify pancreatic cancer are suboptimal stage resulting in a substantially unmet clinical with the majority of cases need. The current imaging approaches are often limited in spatiotemporal resolution and specificity with high inter- and intra-reader variability in radiological exams that often result in flawed evaluation in identifying pancreatic cancer. Our original grant R01EB020125 aimed to utilize UPRT nanoparticles containing IR780 dye to detect pancreatic cancer using Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging. The objective of our administrative supplement is to develop machine learning algorithms to accurately, objectively and consistently assess and distinguish pancreatic cancer versus normal pancreas as utilizing MSOT images. Building upon our experience in theranostic nanoparticles, MSOT imaging, and machine and deep learning, the focus of this supplement is to identify molecular features of pancreatic cancer using MSOT. As MSOT is a new imaging modality, interpreting its images will be challenging for medical professionals. Therefore, we will develop a computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) system which will help physicians to interpret these images accurately and consistently, minimizing inter-reader variability. Similarly, we will develop and evaluate a machine-learning classifier to quantitatively identify pancreatic cancer. Together, these studies aim to optimize and validate our novel MSOT imaging combined with machine learning to identify pancreatic cancer. This project extends our existing grant which develops a pancreatic tumor targeted nanoparticle detectable using multispectral optoacoustic tomography to include evaluation of the images using deep learning. The deep learning algorithms will segment possible pancreatic cancer regions and identify features to characterize possible pancreatic cancer regions.",Deep Learning in the context of Multispectral optoacoustic tomography Administrative supplement,9750320,R01EB020125,"['Algorithms ', ' Computer-Assisted Image Analysis ', ' feature recognition ', ' feature detection ', ' content based retrieval ', ' Computer-Assisted Image Analyses ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Grant ', ' Methods ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' pancreatic neoplasm ', ' pancreatic neoplasia ', ' Pancreatic Tumor ', ' Pancreas Tumor ', ' Pancreas Neoplasms ', ' Physicians ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Specificity ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' nano particle ', ' nanoparticle ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' theranostics ', ' photoacoustic tomography ', ' optoacoustic tomography ', ' imaging approach ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,133300,NC-06,0.017597780673192544
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy ', ' Anniversary ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Awareness ', ' Books ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' method development ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Marshal ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' magnetic field ', ' experience ', ' commune ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' computer science ', ' c new ', ' peer ', ' graduate student ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' International ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' biophysical model ', ' ']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,15000,RI-02,0.01527155285637237
"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving but is limited by a shortage of organ donors and an unacceptably high donor organ discard rate. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on manual quantitation of key microscopic findings by pathologists. A major limitation of this microscopic examination is human variability and inefficiency in interpreting the findings, resulting in potentially healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation or potentially damaged organs being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model capable of automatically quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis in whole slide images of donor kidney frozen section wedge biopsies. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, diminished health care costs, and improved patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated quantitative evaluation as the standard practice of donor kidney evaluation prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert kidney pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the computerized approach to quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis and compare these results with current standard of care pathologist evaluation. The feasibility of deploying the Deep Learning model to analyze whole slide images on the cloud will also be examined. The end product of this STTR will be a web-based platform to securely deploy Deep Learning image analysis as a tool to assist pathologists with donor kidney biopsy evaluation.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9679722,R41MH118845,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Foundations ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Deterioration ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Neurologic Effect ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' web-based service ', ' web services ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' image registration ', ' shape description ', ' shape analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' task analysis ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2018,303226,NY-20,0.020058806195946962

"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9416817,F31CA214029,"['Archives

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation.

The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9526090,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Automation ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Edema ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Learning ', ' Ligaments ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Subchondral Cyst ', ' Supervision ', ' Synovitis ', ' synovial inflammation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Organ ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Meniscus ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' radiologist ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' joint destruction ', ' joint degradation ', ' joint degeneration ', ' impression ', ' parallel processing ', ' speech recognition ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Scheme ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,399482,CA-12,0.018871645441609228
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders.

"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9651713,R03EB027268,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Crystallization ', ' Digital Signal Processing ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Human Engineering ', ' Industry ', ' instrumentation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Photons ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Data Quality ', ' analog ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Route ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' photomultiplier ', ' physical process ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' voltage ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' patient safety ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Network-based ', ' signal processing ', ' network architecture ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,CA-03,0.041228247695291105
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts.

Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning.

"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9494731,R01NS099061,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Apraxias ', ' apraxia ', ' Dyspraxia ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cheese ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Supramarginal Gyrus ', ' Structure of supramarginal gyrus ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2018,381860,PA-02,-0.01940405930227154

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9724174,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Automation ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Edema ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Learning ', ' Ligaments ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Subchondral Cyst ', ' Supervision ', ' Synovitis ', ' synovial inflammation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Organ ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Meniscus ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' radiologist ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' joint destruction ', ' joint degradation ', ' joint degeneration ', ' impression ', ' parallel processing ', ' speech recognition ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Scheme ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,24598,CA-12,0.018871645441609228
"Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions Supplement: Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Complex Data NARRATIVE SUMMARY The landscape of data formats is rapidly expanding, with image, text and other complex formats becoming available for health related outcomes. By considering such data within the context of observational causal inference, they can be leveraged to improve clinical decisions, help evaluate treatment efficacy by estimating individualized treatment effects and help develop intelligent therapeutic systems where individualized treatments can be deployed. In R01EB025021, we concentrate on understanding how nearly exact matching can be achieved in the presence of a large number of categorical covariates. The proposed approach (called FLAME - Fast Large Almost Matching Exactly) is able to quickly learn which categorical covariates are important and to produce high quality matches \citep{wang2017flame,dieng2018collapsing}. The main shortfall in the proposed work for R01EB025021 is that it does not naturally extend to more complex data types, it only works for categorical data in which each feature is meaningful. {\bf This proposal will develop new statistical and computational tools for causal analysis of complex data structures.} Our new approach is called {\emph Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS)}. For each unit (e.g. patient), we propose learn a latent representation of their covariate information and a distance metric on the latent space such that units that are matched tend to provide accurate estimates of treatment effect. MALTS can use deep learning to encode the latent representations for the units, or it can learn basis transformations in linear space (stretching and rotation matrices) for simpler continuous data types. We will develop the MALTS algorithm, and apply it in a medical context. Our goal is to construct high quality matches for the following types of data: (i) medical images, such as x-rays and CT scans, (ii) medical record data, (iii) time series data (continuous EEG data), (iv) a combination of any of the first three types of data. We aim to leverage the newly developed tools to continue our evaluation of the efficacy of isolation for flu-like ailments as well as to apply them more broadly to publicly available modern datasets such as the MIMIC III database. Reliable and consistent causal analysis of public health interventions requires the use of massive previously unavailable datastreams. For example, evaluation of the efficacy of isolation interventions on flu-like-illness spread must include information on friendships and interactions between individuals, biometric information, imaging, longitudinal health record data as well as standard demographic data. The proposed research provides machine learning and deep learning tools for properly employing this data for the identification and quantification of causal effects of such treatments that can lead to the development of better public health interventions.",Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions Supplement: Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Complex Data,9750434,R01EB025021,"['Algorithms ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Stretching ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' flu ', ' treatment effect ', ' data format ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' public health intervention ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,98714,NC-04,0.02150530934614157
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one such intervention that has already been FDA-approved for certain disorders, and its use has already raised ethical questions about ways in which direct brain stimulation may affect personal identity, autonomy, authenticity and, more generally, agency. Thus far the neuroethical worries have been largely based on anecdotal clinical reports. Further neurotechnological interventions developed as part of the BRAIN initiative are bound to raise similar questions, but we lack a clear framework in which to think of the ethical consequences of these interventions. The overall goal of this project is to articulate such a framework, to enable us to better evaluate and respond to the neuroethical challenges raised by our abilities to alter brain function. The more concrete objectives of our proposal are to 1) develop comprehensive assessment tools to measure changes in agency due to direct brain interventions, 2) to use this tool to assess changes in agency due to brain interventions using DBS patient populations as a test case; and 3) to develop a database to house the data we acquire with these tools to allow us to catalogue the effects and side effects of DBS. This will also make it possible to correlate the effects of DBS with electrode placement and white matter tractography, enabling better prediction of outcomes and aid in understanding of the mechanisms by which DBS works. We will analyze this data machine with machine learning methods to inform a more comprehensive neuroethical analysis of how brain interventions affect agency. Our approach is innovative in that it applies neurophilosophical insights about agency and employs deep learning algorithms in constructing and evaluating these assessment instruments. This contribution is significant in that it will provide a broad based assessment tool and database that will be a resource for researchers and clinicians using DBS, which could be used to improve therapeutic approaches and informed consent. The data will also inform a framework for further neuroethical thought about brain interventions, allowing us to better identify, articulate and measure changes on “dimensions of agency.” Finally, the approach is generalizable, and thus could be adapted for use with other brain intervention techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or pharmacological treatments.   Project Narrative: We aim to develop a computerized assessment tool (the Agency Assessment Tool, AAT) to be used by clinicians prior to and after brain interventions to measure changes in agency along multiple dimensions. We will also develop an anonymous database coupled to the AAT that will constitute a central repository for data documenting the effects of DBS. Machine learning methods will be used to build predictive models from the AAT data in order to provide neuroethically relevant predictive and diagnostic information about the effects of brain interventions on agency. ",Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency,9609947,RF1MH117813,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Elements ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Methods ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Competence ', ' Ethicists ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Personhood ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Catalogs ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Structure ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Reporting ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' neurotechnology ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' neuroethics ', ' pre-implantation ', ' preimplantation ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' tractography ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,RF1,2018,1312000,NH-02,0.000873193877223526
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9470767,F31CA221061,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Edema ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Goals ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Data Quality ', ' radiologist ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Gene Chips ', ' gene expression microarray ', ' expression array ', ' GeneChip ', ' Gene Expression Chip ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecule imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' vector ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Population ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' picture archive ', ' image library ', ' image archive ', ' image archival system ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical practice ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' Radiogenomics ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' radiomics ', ' genomic data ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' radiological imaging ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,38615,CA-33,-0.0007378584117285818
"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing

"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning,9762221,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Structures ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Probability ', ' Pupil ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' Competence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' source guides ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' fictional works ', ' fiction ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,94319,CT-03,0.002638080845468625
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",9734599,U01CA239055,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune drugs ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Mitosis Stage ', ' M Phase ', ' Mitosis ', ' Noise ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Paper ', ' Clinical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Quality Control ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' photonics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' ASCO ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' companion diagnostics ', ' learning network ', ' interactive tool ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Nivolumab ', ' Opdivo ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,383459,OH-11,-0.016762536471239094
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism Project Summary/Abstract: The US Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism (PE) a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast, colon, and lung cancers. The current diagnostic standard for suspected PE is CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, the number of CTPA examinations is increasing dramatically, and incorrect CTPA interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis). There is a clinical need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of PE diagnosis at CTPA. Our central hypothesis is that this clinical need can be addressed by exploiting computer-radiologist synergy. However, existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for PE have serious deficiencies: they are limited in sensitivity and specificity, incapable of handling PE over-diagnosis, and operating only at the embolus level―localizing individual emboli, but PE diagnosis is rendered at the patient-level―excluding non-PE patients and dispatching PE-patients to treatment. Therefore, our objective is to overcome these deficiencies with a new methodology. We have built a strong interdisciplinary team, developed an innovative prototype, and evaluated it through our pilot clinical studies, demonstrating outstanding performance. This proposed research has three specific aims: 1) boost our current system’s embolus-level performance with our newly proposed strategies, assisting radiologists in accurately localizing emboli and facilitating precision medicine through risk stratification; 2) achieve patient-level diagnosis through our newly developed algorithms, assisting radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients and improving diagnostic efficiency; and 3) demonstrate clinical benefits of our system by testing specific clinical hypotheses. This research is innovative because (1) our approach to embolus-level detection fundamentally differs from prior approaches in that it requires no vessel segmentation, overcoming their limitations; (2) we are pioneering two uncharted areas: PE patient-level diagnosis and over-diagnosis prevention; we do not perceive any similar objectives in existing NIH grants or publications in the literature; and (3) this project utilizes our original algorithms and will yield multiple novel algorithms. Our project is significant because it (1) addresses a major national health problem; (2) develops a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention, overcoming the deficiencies of the current PE CAD systems; and (3) delivers a next- generation, high-performance PE CAD system that quickly excludes non-PE patients, accurately localizes emboli, and actively prevent PE over-diagnosis, thereby enhancing radiologists’ diagnostic capabilities and supporting precision medicine through risk stratification. Successful completion of the project is expected because (1) we have already made good progress in algorithm development and clinical evaluation; (2) our approach is carefully crafted on solid algorithmic and mathematical foundations; (3) our clinical evaluation is rigorously designed; and (4) our team is uniquely capable and well prepared to conduct this project, which builds upon our innovative research in CAD, pioneering research in deformable models, and world-renowned PIOPED trials. This research is expected to have important impact on PE- related clinical practice, development of decision support systems for many diseases, and medical education. Project Narrative Behind the great success of biomedical imaging, a crisis is looming: the number of imaging studies is growing exponentially; the workload of radiologists is increasing dramatically; the health-care cost related to imaging is rising rapidly—We are facing a grant new challenge: “image data explosion” (a manifestation of big data in biomedical imaging): Modern imaging systems generate enormous data, far exceeding human abilities for interpretation, but what is paramount are not the images themselves, rather the clinically relevant information contained within the images; therefore, our long-term goal is to develop and validate comprehensive, high-performance computational tools that automatically and quantitatively extract clinically relevant information from images to support clinical decision making and facilitate precision medicine. To demonstrate the immediate, measurable impact of our research, we have chosen pulmonary embolism as our initial research platform because the Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motor vehicle accidents combined; with laudable efforts to diagnose pulmonary embolism, the number of CT studies for suspected pulmonary embolism has been increasing dramatically, while incorrect CT interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis); therefore, there is a clinical need to (1) mitigate radiologists’ workloads and (2) improve the efficiency and accuracy for pulmonary embolism diagnosis using CT. Our objective is to address this clinical need by exploiting radiologist-computer synergy, delivering two important outcomes: (a) a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention; and (b) a next-generation, high- performance system that will be able to assist radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients without overlooking positive patients, accurately localizing individual emboli to support personalized treatments through risk stratification, and actively preventing PE over-diagnosis, exerting an important positive impact on clinical practice associated with pulmonary embolism—a life-threatening condition.",Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism,9741795,R01HL128785,"['Traffic accidents ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Arteries ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Medical Education ', ' Embolus ', ' Embolism ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Explosion ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Veins ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' General Practices ', ' Social Impacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' radiologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' novel ', ' vehicular accident ', ' motor vehicle accident ', ' Motor carrier accident ', ' Prevention ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' bioimaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bio-imaging ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' prototype ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' imaging system ', ' Risk stratification ', ' imaging study ', ' clinical decision support ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NHLBI,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,586687,AZ-09,-0.061173164302249686
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning,9952966,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Structures ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Probability ', ' Pupil ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' Competence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' source guides ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' fictional works ', ' fiction ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,281463,MD-07,0.002638080845468625
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,9830975,F31NS113385,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Play ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Posture ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' miniaturize ', ' complement pathway ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' optogenetics ', ' study population ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' microendoscopy ', ' endomicroscopy ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38342,MA-07,-0.016663429713391482
"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,9816407,R01NS081118,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Ataxia ', ' Dyssynergia ', ' Coordination Impairment ', ' Ataxy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellar cortex structure ', ' Cerebellar Nuclei ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Dysarthosis ', ' Dysarthria ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Grant ', ' Harmidine ', ' Dihydroharmine ', ' Harmaline ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Paresthesia ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' zona incerta ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Intention Tremor ', ' Action Tremors ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Funding ', ' Essential Tremor ', ' Benign Essential Tremor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' electric field ', ' instrument ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' magnetic field ', ' particle ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' somatosensory ', ' Implant ', ' deep brain stimulation array ', ' arm ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' motor symptom ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,583682,MN-05,-0.020315314423928452
"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD.

"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9656869,F31CA221061,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Goals ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Data Quality ', ' radiologist ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Gene Chips ', ' gene expression microarray ', ' expression array ', ' GeneChip ', ' Gene Expression Chip ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' vector ', ' cluster computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' image archival system ', ' picture archive ', ' image library ', ' image archive ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Radiogenomics ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' radiomics ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,39107,CA-33,-0.0007378584117285818
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,9712062,R01CA237269,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Beds ', ' Communication ', ' Conceptions ', ' Consultations ', ' Curiosities ', ' Due Process ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune drugs ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Individuality ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' satisfaction ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' HNC patient ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' arm ', ' Systems Development ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individual patient ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,584676,TX-30,0.03392116288517783
"Development of Deep Neural Networks for Automated Detection of Cancer Metastases in Staging Laparoscopy Images SUMMARY For patients who undergo operative resections for gastrointestinal cancers, treatment selection fundamentally relies on the result of intra-operative assessment of the extent of the underlying cancer (i.e. staging). Specifically, the absence or presence of distant metastases dictates the role of operative treatment, chemotherapy, and radiation. However, the accuracy of operative staging (i.e. staging laparoscopy) is limited resulting in “under-staging” in up to 30% of these patients adversely affecting their cancer treatment. While operative “under-staging” is thought to equally affect many other malignancies, the cause is believed to arise from the inability of a conventional operative exam to reliably differentiate benign from metastatic lesions. Recent results demonstrated that expert surgeons on average misidentify 36±19% of grossly visible metastases questioning the accuracy of a human examiner.  Our long-term goal is to significantly improve the accuracy of operative staging laparoscopy in patients with gastrointestinal cancers by enhancing its capability to detect metastases through means of machine learning. To achieve this goal, we will use existing videos from staging laparoscopies and abstract images of peritoneal lesions that underwent biopsy (i.e. ground truth) as part of routine care (Aim 1). These images will then be used for the development of an automated classification system. The first step of developing the classification system involves training of a deep neural network with weak supervision that will allow for automated segmentation of lesions from their surrounding background (Aim 2). The second step will extract feature vectors from the lesions segmented in Aim 2 providing information for classification. The feature vectors will be extracted by two parallel processes: unsupervised deep learning and extraction of expert-selected features. The resulting feature vectors will be used to train a model allowing the classification (benign vs. metastasis) of any peritoneal lesion (Aim 3).  The results of this study are expected to provide material for future improvements / modifications of the proposed deep learning classification system as well as the foundation for future development of an automated surgical guidance system designed to help surgeons reliably identify metastases. Relevance: This study will establish a robust, yet simple method to improve the staging accuracy of standard laparoscopy via the detection of peritoneal metastases otherwise missed by human examiners. This will significantly improve cancer care through better treatment allocation. Further, it is expected that the detection of currently missed metastases will have a major impact on staging and treatment algorithms for a variety of cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE During operations to treat gastrointestinal cancers, disease spread to other sites (i.e. metastases) is not recognized in a significant proportion of patients adversely affecting their cancer care. The proposed study will utilize artificial intelligence computer algorithms that will allow for automated identification and classification of such metastases.

"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology

"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Project Narrative: InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility of automatically analyzing radiotracer biodistributions of small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution analysis is currently operator-dependent, time-consuming, and prone to error while reducing the reproducibility of study results. The proposed technology will be fully automated, operator- independent, and will facilitate the development of new therapies in small animal models of infection, inflammation, and cancer.",Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET,9680585,R43CA224841,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Play ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Posture ', ' Probability ', ' Radionuclides ', ' Radioactive Isotopes ', ' Radioisotopes ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Shoulder ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translations ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' subcutaneous ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' radiotracer ', ' radiolabel ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' dosimetry ', ' Skeleton ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 18FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18-FDG ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' tumor xenograft ', ' Biodistribution ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' Consumption ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' Plug-in ', ' platform-independent ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' commercial application ', ' tumor ', ' Geometry ', ' cloud based ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' animal imaging ', ' imaging platform ', ' software as a service ', ' therapeutic candidate ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NCI,"IN VIVO ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2019,222931,NY-10,-0.012881688003657039
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Automation ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cartilage ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Learning ', ' Ligaments ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Semantics ', ' Subchondral Cyst ', ' Supervision ', ' synovial inflammation ', ' inflamed synovium ', ' inflamed synovial tissue ', ' Synovitis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Organ ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' radiologist ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee OA ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' joint destruction ', ' joint degradation ', ' joint degeneration ', ' impression ', ' parallel processing ', ' speech recognition ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Scheme ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,CA-12,0.018871645441609228
"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality.

"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion

"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases. This project will facilitate rapid quantitative imaging with freely breathing subjects.",Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI,10007241,R56EB028254,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' Literature ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Myocardium ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Relaxation ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Series ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Infiltration ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' coronary fibrosis ', ' myocardial fibrosis ', ' cardiac fibrosis ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' physical property ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Balance training ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' data space ', ' Network-based ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' volunteer ', ' loss of function ', ' motion sensitivity ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R56,2019,347527,VA-05,-0.005458974663407159
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9798875,R01EB028591,"['Affect ', ' Alkalies ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Calcium Oxalate ', ' calcium salt Ethanedioic acid ', ' calcium phosphate ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minerals ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Trioxopurine ', ' Uric Acid ', ' Urolith ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Research Subjects ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Ureteroscopy ', ' Surface ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Cost Effective Management ', ' Cost Efficient Management ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' risk minimization ', ' clinical investigation ', ' photon-counting detector ', ' single photon detector ', ' photon detection ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357486,MN-01,0.019069311360071225
"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9803774,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiology ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ice ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mathematic Computing ', ' Math Computing ', ' Mathematical Computing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' image archival system ', ' picture archive ', ' image library ', ' image archive ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Geometry ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' clinical investigation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,631809,UT-02,0.0188202006888659
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",9882865,U24EB029011,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Licensing ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' medical implant ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' clinical investigation ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,340827,UT-02,0.017727522318913468
"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency prediction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9637337,F31CA214029,"['Archives

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose.

"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['Behavior ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Myelin ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Protons ', ' Relaxation ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Measurement ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' millimeter ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Performance ', ' physical process ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' simulation ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' imaging system ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,NY-12,-0.02144993553854056
"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,9807793,R21CA240881,"['tumor-specific antigen ', ' cancer antigens ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' Work ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lymphocyte Count ', ' Total Lymphocyte Count ', ' Lymphocyte Number ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Bayesian Prediction ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Collaborations ', ' Tumor Escape ', ' tumor immune evasion ', ' tumor evasion ', ' cancer immune evasion ', ' cancer immune escape ', ' cancer evasion ', ' Tumor Immune Escape ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Distant ', ' Inferior ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' autologous lymphocytes ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Effectiveness ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' Nomograms ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Proliferating ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' safety study ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fundamental research ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical translation ', ' Combination immunotherapy ', ' dual immunotherapy ', ' combinatorial immunotherapy ', ' side effect ', ' Blood Component Removal ', ' Pheresis ', ' Hemapheresis ', ' Apheresis ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Immunological Surveillances ', ' Immunological Surveillance ', ' Immunologic Surveillances ', ' Immune Surveillance ', ' Immunologic Surveillance ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune drugs ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Incidence ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Lymphocytopenia ', ' Lymphopenia ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' radiation effect ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2019,211410,TX-09,-0.008142881445333773

"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9784818,R03EB027268,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Crystallization ', ' Digital Signal Processing ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Human Engineering ', ' Industry ', ' instrumentation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Si element ', ' Silicon ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Photons ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Data Quality ', ' analog ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Route ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Performance ', ' photomultiplier ', ' physical process ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' voltage ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' patient safety ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Network-based ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,78500,CA-03,0.041228247695291105
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with

"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9699553,R01NS099061,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Apraxias ', ' apraxia ', ' Dyspraxia ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cheese ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Structure of supramarginal gyrus ', ' Supramarginal Gyrus ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' treatment strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2019,394895,PA-02,-0.01940405930227154
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9624738,R01CA193730,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Probability ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Protons ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Organ ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' magnetic field ', ' electron density ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Geometry ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' primary endpoint ', ' primary end point ', ' radiation delivery ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,343572,CA-18,0.020477688664148844
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Complication ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' corneal ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal transplant ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pathologic Dilatation ', ' Ectasia ', ' Pathological Dilatation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Keratoconus ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Family suidae ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visually impaired ', ' vision impairment ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Procedures ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' incision ', ' Otomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Laser In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser-Assisted Stromal In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileuses ', ' LASIK ', ' Property ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Torsion ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' mechanical properties ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' ']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,OH-11,0.01401766424520405
"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9706921,R01HL142036,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' aortic valve ', ' aortic valve replacement ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' ascending aorta ', ' Attention ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Engineering ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Cardiac Valves ', ' Heart Valves ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Bicuspid Valve ', ' Mitral Valve ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Running ', ' Stents ', ' Testing ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translations ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Device Designs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' heart occlusion ', ' cardiac occlusion ', ' Coronary Occlusions ', ' Guidelines ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' heart function ', ' function of the heart ', ' cardiac function ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' time resolved data ', ' Response Elements ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' Geometry ', ' Problem Sets ', ' Homework Exercises ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' virtual clinical trial ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical imaging ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,381629,GA-05,-0.010666631410297263
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Communities ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' radiologist ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Reader ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Step training ', ' Step retraining ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' data acquisition ', ' data space ', ' patient population ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,NY-12,0.024084764318451
"An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project, we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits. Project Narrative Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy. ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency and improve patient safety.",An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy,9845105,R42CA195819,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Intelligence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Records ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Safety ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Medical Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' patient safety ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' treatment center ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' maltreatment ', ' mistreatment ', ' prospective ', ' data structure ', ' treatment site ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' tumor ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Software Framework ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ']",NCI,"INFONDRIAN, LLC",R42,2019,894987,IA-02,0.01841182796759938
"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment. To address the limitations of current computational methods, this project will apply cutting-edge deep-learning methods to deliver new computational methods and tools with improved accuracy and detailed sub-organelle prediction for protein localization.",Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs,9768571,R21LM012790,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Hybrids ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Organelles ', ' Peptides ', ' Plants ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' Protein translocation ', ' Transmembrane Protein Transport ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' N-terminal ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2019,205330,MO-04,0.02516398196661812
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intraobserver Variations ', ' Intra-Observer Variation ', ' Intra-Observer Variability ', ' Intraobserver Variability ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Investigative Technics ', ' Investigative Techniques ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' spine disorder ', ' Spinal Diseases ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Central cord canal structure ', ' Central Canal of Spinal Cord ', ' Central Canal ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Performance ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Radiculopathy ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' demographics ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' relational database ', ' network architecture ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' imaging study ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,CA-33,0.0006794588521561601
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9745302,R01CA206100,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Normal Distribution ', ' Gaussian Distribution ', ' Normal Statistical Distribution ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Physicians ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Rectum ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Sample Size ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' IGRT ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' deep learning ', ' random forest ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,1,NC-04,-0.0701485067333261
"Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a study of radiomic texture analysis in terms of robustness assessment and classification utility. We will introduce novel robustness metrics geared towards assessment of radiomic features in comparison across two image conditions, and apply these metrics to study feature robustness across imaging parameters and patient biology. In addressing the utility of radiomic features in cancer risk assessment, we will identify and evaluate texture signatures from mammography and tomosynthesis datasets. The field of radiomics is evolving fast, and quantitative texture analysis is being applied to a growing number of applications in medical imaging. By performing a thorough investigation of the robustness of these radiomic features to dataset heterogeneities we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used features to guide their implementations on future applications.  Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) risk assessment and cancer prediction and 2) malignancy evaluation. Multiple modalities including tomosynthesis, mammography and MRI will be involved in studies geared towards addressing these clinical questions. An evaluation of the robustness of commonly employed radiomic features will help guide the field of medical texture analysis and contribute to meaningful conclusions in future studies throughout the field of quantitative image analysis. The first aim of the proposed research involves the proposition and evaluation of novel robustness metrics for investigations lacking a classification task. The second aim will extend the study of radiomics to investigate the utility of robust features in classification tasks and identification of texture signatures relate to biomedical characteristics. The third aim will build upon the two previous aims and culminate in the application of cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and deep learning in further promoting image processing in the field of medical physics. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and improve the application of radiomic texture features in cancer risk assessment. We will accomplish this by evaluating the robustness of various radiomic metrics, testing the classification utility of texture features in clinical tasks, and extending current classification methods to include cutting-edge developments in machine learning technology. Careful preliminary studies have demonstrated methods for selection of robust texture features and improvement in classification tasks by emphasizing feature robustness in feature selection methodology and we therefore believe that a meticulous evaluation of the impact of imaging parameters on feature calculations will lead to overall improvement of computer-aided diagnosis and clinical translation to progress in cancer screening protocols.",Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment,9683697,F31CA228247,"['Biology ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Intuition ', ' Descriptor ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' image registration ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' expression subtypes ', ' radiomics ', ' tomosynthesis ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,24304,IL-01,-0.013974993249773242
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest.

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron

"Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning Project Summary Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits, and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products (cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2) they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability, binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies.

"BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations Project Summary/Abstract The applicant’s goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational biomedical informatics researcher in the area of computational drug repurposing. Exploring novel drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug development. In order to lower the overall costs and uncover more potential screening targets, computational (in silico) methods have become popular and are commonly applied to poly-pharmacology and drug repurposing. Although machine learning-based strategies have been studied for years, there is no standardized benchmark that provides large-scale training datasets as well as diverse evaluation tasks to test different methods. Furthermore, the existing methods suffer from remarkable limitations, where 1) results are often biased due to a lack of negative samples, 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored, and 3) the comprehensive topological structure cannot be captured by feature learning methods . Therefore, in the era of big data, the applicant proposes a study to tackle the challenges by achieving two aims. • Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Develop a large scale benchmark for evaluating drug-target prediction based on the  generation of a multipartite network from heterogeneous biomedical datasets. • Aim 2 (R00 Phase): Adapt a deep learning model to build an accurate predictive model based on a novel  feature learning algorithm that mines the multi-dimensional biomedical network (multipartite network). In the mentored phase, the applicant will integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets and build a benchmark for evaluation of the drug-target prediction based on well-designed strategies. The applicant will receive training in standardization tools for data integration, tools, and skills for data management, evaluation methods for drug-target predictions, and state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning methods in computer-aided pharmacology. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will develop a deep learning-based predictive model and multi-dimensional graph embedding methods for feature learning. Together, these novel studies will advance the current computational drug repurposing by providing 1) comprehensive benchmarking for testing and evaluation, and 2) a scalable and accurate predictive model based on a biomedical multi-partite network. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in Semantic Web, computational biology, cancer genomics, drug development, and machine learning/deep learning. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish independent research programs in 1) computational drug repurposing in real cases, 2) investigation of the diverse hidden associations in system biology (e.g., associations between drugs, genetics, and diseases), and 3) precision medicine aimed applications leveraging biomedical knowledgebases and electronic health records. Project Narrative The field of computational drug repurposing lacks a large scale benchmark that provides comprehensive and standard evaluation tasks as well as a scalable and accurate prediction model that can handle large biomedical datasets. This study aims to utilize Semantic Web technology to construct a multi-partite network based on heterogeneous biomedical databases and develop a deep learning-based predictive model based on the network.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections.

"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,9962505,R01NS081118,"['Modeling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' somatosensory ', ' Implant ', ' deep brain stimulation array ', ' arm ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' motor symptom ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Ataxia ', ' Ataxy ', ' Coordination Impairment ', ' Dyssynergia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellar Nuclei ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dysarthria ', ' Dysarthosis ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Grant ', ' Harmaline ', ' Dihydroharmine ', ' Harmidine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Paresthesia ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' zona incerta ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Action Tremors ', ' Intention Tremor ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Funding ', ' Benign Essential Tremor ', ' Essential Tremor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' electric field ', ' instrument ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' magnetic field ', ' particle ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Radiation ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,549049,MN-05,-0.020315314423928452
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques.

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",9942654,R01GM136859,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Crowding ', ' Drug Design ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Proteins ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Specialist ', ' HMQC ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biochemical ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Pyruvate ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' methyl group ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' nuclear power ', ' COSY ', ' TOCSY ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Scheme ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' radiofrequency ', ' radio frequency ', ' control theory ', ' non-linear regression ', ' nonlinear regression ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,495502,MA-07,-0.002347379530882977
"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Pathology ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' insight ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' tissue oxygen saturation ', ' tissue oxygenation ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computerized ', ' macular ', ' macula ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' RNFL ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' clinical practice ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematical methods ', ' invention ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' preservation ', ' retina imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' ocular imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,NY-12,0.004974087661767952
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress.

"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' corneal transplant ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pathological Dilatation ', ' Ectasia ', ' Pathologic Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' cross-link ', ' crosslink ', ' Procedures ', ' Otomy ', ' incision ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' LASIK ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileuses ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis ', ' Laser-Assisted Stromal In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Property ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Torsion ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanoscale ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' mechanical properties ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' first in man ', ' first-in-human ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,OH-11,0.01401766424520405
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",9897498,U01CA239055,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' NSCLC ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Histology ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' lymph cell ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Mitosis ', ' M Phase ', ' Mitosis Stage ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Paper ', ' Clinical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality Control ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' photonics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' ECOG ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' ASCO ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' companion diagnostics ', ' learning network ', ' interactive tool ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Opdivo ', ' Nivolumab ', ' Visualization ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' heterogenous data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' TCIA ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,381138,OH-11,-0.016762536471239094
"Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings. In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter- pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis. We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis is imprecise, and marked by significant inter-pathologist discordance in readings.

"A New Paradigm for Systems Physiology Modeling: Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation with Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER) Many promising peripheral neuromodulation techniques have been proposed to treat lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, but our lack of predictive models has forced the community (including the PI’s lab) to explore the vast parameter space of nerve targets, stimulation parameterizations, and electrode designs empirically in animal experiments by trial and error. This type of exploratory experimentation is the only current method of optimizing, personalizing, or discovering novel LUT neuromodulation techniques. Motivated by this clinical need, our long-term goal for this work is to predict the effects of neuromodulation on the LUT. To move toward this goal, we propose to develop a new modeling framework that integrates disparate biophysics models through machine learning, thereby emulating an entire organ system through a process we call Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation of Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER). We will develop and use the general BLADDER framework to create an organ-level model of the normal healthy LUT throughout its filling and voiding cycles, including non-volitional neural reflex control over the bladder and urethra. Our focus on neural reflex control and organ-level scales ensures that, if successful, the BLADDER LUT model will be poised to predict effects of neuromodulation using computational studies, which so far has been impossible due to the complexity of the LUT. The BLADDER framework unites multiple individual mechanistic models (each accounting for a component function of an organ system) by using deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) to learn the appropriate coupling dynamics linking each component model. The combination of mechanistic and machine learning models under a single framework allows us to harness the advantages of both: mechanistic models excel at interpretability but suffer from a lack of scalability (becoming intractable at the level of organ systems), while machine learning models are excellent at scale but lack generalizability and insights for hypothesis generation. The BLADDER framework will scale up mechanistic models to the level of systems physiology by linking tractable model components together using a supervisory RNN, allowing the BLADDER framework to deliver both interpretability and scale. We will draw on existing SPARC datasets in the cat (e.g., Bruns and Gaunt), existing publicly available data in rat, and generate new data in the rat to construct a training dataset for the supervisory RNN. We will further draw from already published small-scale mechanistic models, validated on human and animal data, for the mechanistic components of the BLADDER LUT model. The formal process of identifying these models and datasets, and checking their validity and robustness, will clearly reveal the deficits and strengths in our theoretical and experimental understanding of the LUT in a straightforward and rational way. We will use the 10 Simple Rules to vet mechanistic models for inclusion in the BLADDER LUT model and compile a public inventory for the neurourology community. Major task 1 (Q1-2): Identify available datasets and candidate mechanistic models from published literature. Major deliverables are a public database and a whitepaper detailing the state of the field and prospects for modeling and experimental work. Major Task 2 (Q1-3): Demonstrate proof of concept of BLADDER framework. Major deliverables are a publicly available code linking two LUT component models via supervisory RNN and a report on suitable RNN architectures based on fully described dynamical systems. Major Task 3 (Q3-6): Create a multi-component BLADDER model. Major deliverables are code used to link separate mechanistic LUT models via the supervisory RNN, and an in vivo rat dataset to fill in critical measurables for the machine learning training set. Major Task 4 (Q6-8): Deploy the fully operational BLADDER model of the LUT, including autonomously predicted neural reflex control. Major deliverables are publicly available codes and datasets, and a hypothesis-driven computational experiment to predict simple interventions.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,10003010,R01CA206100,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Normal Statistical Distribution ', ' Gaussian Distribution ', ' Normal Distribution ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Physicians ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Rectum ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Sample Size ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' IGRT ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' deep learning ', ' random forest ', ' Patient imaging ', ' prostatectomy radiotherapy ', ' prostate radiotherapy ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,315338,NC-04,-0.0701485067333261
"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice.

"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10154293,F31NS118930,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Foundations ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Reference Values ', ' Reference Ranges ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Equation ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Predictive Value ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' contrast imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' Patient imaging ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,IL-01,-0.01955484046789829
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intraobserver Variability ', ' Intra-Observer Variability ', ' Intra-Observer Variation ', ' Intraobserver Variations ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Investigative Techniques ', ' Investigative Technics ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spinal Diseases ', ' spine disorder ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Central Canal ', ' Central Canal of Spinal Cord ', ' Central cord canal structure ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Performance ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Radiculopathy ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' demographics ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' relational database ', ' network architecture ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' imaging study ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' clinical database ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' software infrastructure ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,CA-33,0.0006794588521561601
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['Behavior ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Myelin ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Relaxation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Measurement ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' millimeter ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Performance ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' physical process ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D Print ', ' imaging system ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,NY-12,-0.02144993553854056
"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9969467,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiology ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ice ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mathematical Computing ', ' Math Computing ', ' Mathematic Computing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' picture archive ', ' image archival system ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Geometry ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' clinical investigation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' algorithm development ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,614363,UT-02,0.0188202006888659
"Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness ABSTRACT  It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape.  One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.  This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level, where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and fetal medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The robust establishment of correct shape is essential for proper tissue function. Tissue shape change is a mechanical process that necessitates the coordinated force generation and motion of thousands of cells. Identifying how physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape will shed light onto many congenital disorders that result from morphogenetic dysregulation.",Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness,9950519,K99GM136915,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Actomyosin ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosins ', ' Neural Tube Defects ', ' Neural Tube Developmental Defects ', ' Noise ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' Cell Size ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Congenital Disorders ', ' Galaxy ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohesion ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' malformation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' fetal medicine ', ' optogenetics ', ' mechanical properties ', ' mechanical force ', ' Maternal-fetal medicine ', ' confocal imaging ', ' tissue-level behavior ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,98836,MA-07,-0.002997001481733961
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' bone ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' Calibration ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Femur ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Records ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' hip bone ', ' Pelvic Bones ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' standing height ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Intramuscular ', ' experience ', ' ductile ', ' cohort ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Finite Element Analyses ', ' Finite Element Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' fall risk ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' electronic data ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' neuromuscular ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' bone strength ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' abdominal computed tomography ', ' abdominal CT ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' biomechanical model ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' fracture risk ', ' clinical translation ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' patient health information ', ' ']",NIAMS,"O.

"Developing deep learning models for precision oncology Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning models (DLMs), to learn a better representation of activation states of cellular signaling pathways in an individual tumor and use such information to predict its sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling pathways, and aberrations in pathways eventually lead to cancer development. Precision oncology aims to accurately detect and target tumor-specific aberrations, but challenges remain. Currently, there is no well-established method to detect the activation states of signaling pathways, and the common practice of using mutation status of a targeted gene as the indicator for prescribing a molecularly targeted drug has limitations. To overcome such limitation, we hypothesize that, by closely simulating the hierarchical organization of cellular signaling systems, DLMs can be used to systematically identify major cancer signaling pathways, to detect tumor-specific aberrations in signaling pathways, and to predict cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs.  We will develop models that more precisely represent the state of signaling systems in cancer cells and use such information to enhance precision oncology. I will design and apply innovative DLMs to cancer big data, including large-scale pharmacogenomic data and cancer omics data to learn unified representation of aberrations in signaling systems caused by driver SGAs in cancer cell, despite of their different growth conditions, such as in cell culture, PDX and real tumor. This will enable us to transfer the models trained using cell lines and PDXs to clinical setting (real tumors) in future. By the nature of drugs that may share common target proteins, we develop model DLM-MLT (the combination of DLM and multi-task learning) to predict the sensitivity of tumor samples to multiple drugs at once. Furthermore, we will develop model BioSI-DLM to use various perturbations (ex. SGA/LINCS perturbation data) as side information to learn better representation that potentially map latent variables in a DLM to biological entities. We hypothesize that the representation learned from our designed models will significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the conventional indication for drug treatment (ex. mutation state of the drug targeting protein). In summary, our study uses deep learning based machine learning methods to learn better and concise representation embedded in the cancer omics data to reflect the personalized genomic changes, which could be used to guide the personalized treatment. Our study could significantly contribute to the development of cancer ontology and promote the development of precision medicine. Project Narrative Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The proposed project aims to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning, to study cellular signaling systems and disease mechanism. A better representation embedded in the cancer omics data will improve the prediction of drug sensitivity and patient survival.

"Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders. Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent a largely undefined component of the genetic architecture of neurological disorders, as a number of MEIs have been associated with alternative splicing in these disorders but large-scale genome-wide functional characterization has not been systematically performed across tissues. This program study will functionally characterize the impact of MEIs on alternative splicing from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in large cohorts using new developments in deep learning models. These results will enhance our understanding of the etiological role and pathogenic mechanisms associated with MEIs in neuronal development and human neurological disorders.",Deep learning approaches

"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery.

"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone. The prediction tools will be applied through collaborations with experimental scientists and disseminated to the community.",Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction,10051137,R01GM093123,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Genome ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Weight ', ' Renaissance ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' monomer ', ' Performance ', ' structural biology ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Homo ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Region ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' self assembly ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' C-terminal ', ' open source ', ' comparative ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' learning network ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' long short term memory ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,342270,MO-04,0.018266789398978786
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications.

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning,9929660,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Structures ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Probability ', ' Pupil ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' Competence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' source guides ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' fiction ', ' fictional works ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387421,MD-07,0.002638080845468625
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.

"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines. Project Narrative The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research, disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction.

"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,10026026,F31NS113385,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' miniaturize ', ' complement pathway ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' optogenetics ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' endomicroscopy ', ' microendoscopy ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' Postural alterations ', ' Postural changes ', ' Postural adjustments ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33352,MA-07,-0.016663429713391482
"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10138826,R42DK120253,"['Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Trichrome stain ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' glomerular sclerosis ', ' glomerulosclerosis ', ' image processing ', ' Organ ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' interstitial ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' technological innovation ', ' Modeling ', ' Trichrome ', ' Trichrome stain method ', ' Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' analytical tool ', ' function improvement ', ' functional improvement ', ' commercial application ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Secure ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' cloud server ', ' cloud platform ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' renal biopsy ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' renal damage ', ' FHIR ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' shared data base ', ' shared database ', ' Adoption ', ' Americas ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Canada ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' ']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2020,811695,MO-01,-0.023975896309035367
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Learning ', ' Ligaments ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Subchondral Cyst ', ' Supervision ', ' Synovitis ', ' inflamed synovial tissue ', ' inflamed synovium ', ' synovial inflammation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Organ ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Meniscus ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' radiologist ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' joint degeneration ', ' joint degradation ', ' joint destruction ', ' impression ', ' parallel processing ', ' speech recognition ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Scheme ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' feature extraction ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,CA-12,0.018871645441609228
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices.

"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9986814,R21EY030619,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' prognostic ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Staging ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Staging System ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Visit ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' geographic atrophy ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Early intervention trials ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' progression biomarker ', ' progression marker ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' Data Pooling ', ' ']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2020,196250,CA-34,0.018200228396692605
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,9976348,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Population Explosions ', ' Program Development ', ' Publishing ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' success ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' stem ', ' tool development ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' network architecture ', ' genetic information ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' random forest ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,529154,OR-04,0.0025568554765622023
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects.

"Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Cervical cancer affects approximately 7.4/100,000 women in the US with minority women being disproportionally affected. High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is an effective treatment modality by irradiating the tumor from inside while simultaneously sparing dose to nearby organs. Multiple randomized trials revealed that including HDR brachytherapy in cervical cancer radiotherapy increases overall survival rates from 46.2% to 58.2%. Yet HDR brachytherapy has seen a downward trend in its use, with complex treatment planning process being one of the major reasons, causing a 13% reduction in cause-specific survival rate. For HDR brachytherapy, the planning has to be accomplished in a very short period of time to reduce patient discomfort and patient motion during the planning process, which could causes substantial deviation of planning geometry from delivery geometry (1.5mm motion leads to >10% change in dose). At present, it takes on average 135 min to manually generate a treatment plan. Due to the time pressure, suboptimal plans are often generated. D2cc, the dosimetric quantity correlated to organ toxicity could be further reduced up to 8.4%, corresponding to 5.1% reduction of complication rate. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a fully automated treatment planning process to reduce planning time, improve plan quality and therefore outcome, reduce patient discomfort, and most significantly, to promote the use of HDR brachytherapy. Our group has successfully developed and clinically implemented the AutoBrachy system, an automatic planning tool that generates a patient-generic plan in 3 minutes. However, automatic organ segmentation and physician-oriented treatment planning are missing, preventing a fully automated process to generate the patient-specific optimal plan. Current practice relies on human expertise to solve the two problems, taking up to 90 min for segmentation and 30 min for planner and physician to finalize plan. Given the recent advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in mimicking humans to achieve human-level performance, we believe that AI can be used to empower AutoBrachy to achieve a fully automated planning process. The overall goal of this fellowship project is to develop AI-based organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning modules in AutoBrachy, and to validate the system in real patient cases. We will pursue two specific aims (SAs): SA1: System development. Create an automatic organ segmentation module and a human-like automatic planning module. SA2: System validation. Perform a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of the developments. The innovation is the use of state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve critical problems in HDR brachytherapy. This project is logically built on the candidate’s engineering background and medical physics training. It targets at a disease that is highly significant to the underserved population, for which the candidate is highly motivated to solve. The project also fits perfectly with the candidate's long-term career goal of establishing a high-quality independent research program to develop state-of-the-art treatment methods for cancer radiotherapy. NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate artificial intelligence based computational modules for automatic organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning to achieve a fully automated and streamlined treatment planning process for high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a severe disease, particularly affecting underserved population who typically present at advanced stages. The developed tools will lead to clinical benefits to patients by improving plan quality, planning efficiency, and patient comfort, as well as will reduce the technical burden of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and therefore promote the use of this effective therapeutic modality to yield broad impacts.",Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer,9991582,F31CA243504,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Brachytherapy ', ' Curietherapy ', ' Radiation Brachytherapy ', ' Radioisotope Brachytherapy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Small Intestines ', ' small bowel ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physics ', ' pressure ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Sigmoid ', ' Sigmoid colon ', ' Genetic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy ', ' meetings ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' career development ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' tumor ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Systems Development ', ' Geometry ', ' Irradiated tumor ', ' individual patient ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34644,TX-30,0.0363119049672503
"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation GWAS Project Summary/Abstract  Predicting phenotypes from DNA sequence variation is a major goal for genetics with potential applications in evolutionary biology, crop breeding, and public health. A central challenge in this task is separating genetic and environmental effects on phenotypes. In natural populations breeding structure is often correlated with the environment across space such that different subpopulations experience different environments. For genome-wide association studies (GWAS) this creates a problem: genetic and environmental effects can be confounded by population structure, leading to inflated test statistics and low predictive power across populations (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015, Mathieson and Mcvean, 2012). Understanding when association studies are biased by population stratification and creating better methods to correct for it are thus important challenges for population genetics over the next decade.  To identify conditions under which existing methods of population stratification correction are subject to bias and develop robust new alternatives suitable for use with the continental-scale genomic datasets that are now routinely available for humans, we propose to use simulations and machine learning to separate the signals of fine-scale ancestry from polygenic phenotype association. In our first aim we will develop simulations of polygenic phenotype evolution in continuous space and use the output to evaluate existing methods of stratification control including linear mixed models, PC correction, and LD score regression. In this aim we will seek to identify the regions of parameter space – i.e. the strength of isolation by distance and the spatial distribution of environmental variation – in which existing methods can be expected to produce reliable effect size estimates, and establish guidelines for applications of GWAS to structured populations.  We will then train machine learning algorithms on real genotype data from humans and mosquitoes to describe continuous structure in large spatial samples using a variational autoencoder, a dimensionality reduction technique based on deep neural networks that can take advantage of both allele frequency and haplotype-based measures of differentiation in a single analysis and thus offer improved control of stratification inflation in GWAS relative to the now standard PCA regression approach. Last we will apply deep learning techniques to the problem of linking phenotypes and genotypes in structured samples by training neural networks on simulated phenotypes and empirical genetic data. By training our networks on empirical genetic data and incorporating contextual information about surrounding haplotype structure into the model, our networks should learn to discriminate causal associations from false positives created by population structure in the sample cohort, which will improve performance when attempting to identify associations with the real phenotype. These methods will be applied to existing genomic datasets of height in humans, tested against the current state-of-the-art approaches, and packaged as scalable software for the broader scientific community. Project Narrative Separating the signals of polygenic trait association and population structure has emerged as a major challenge for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We propose to develop new simulations of populations evolving in continuous space that will allow us to rigorously benchmark existing methods of stratification control in GWAS while fully controlling the underlying demographic and selective process. We will then apply deep learning techniques to develop (1) a new method of dimensionality reduction to test as a covariate for ancestry in GWAS, and (2) a neural network that identifies genotype-phenotype connections while controlling for population structure in the sample cohort.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation GWAS,9910009,F32GM136123,"['Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Biology ', ' Breeding ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Height ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Oligogenic Inheritances ', ' Oligogenic Traits ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' large scale simulation ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' TOPMed ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' population stratification ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F32,2020,19290,OR-04,-0.03539660071710163
"ShapeWorks in the Cloud Project Summary This application is submitted in response to NOT-OD-20-073 as an administrative supplement to the parent award R01AR076120 titled: ""Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches."" The form (or shape) of anatomies is the clinical language that describes abnormal mor- phologies tied to pathologic functions. Quantifying such subtle morphological shape changes requires parsing the anatomy into a quantitative description that is consistent across the population in question. For more than 100 years, morphometrics has been an indispensable quantitative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms. But its representation capacity is limited to linear distances, angles, and areas. Sta- tistical shape modeling (SSM) is the computational extension of classical morphometric techniques to analyze more detailed representations of complex anatomy and their variability within populations The parent award ad- dresses existing roadblocks for the widespread adoption of SSM computational tools in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of open-source software tools, ShapeWorks. ShapeWorks enables learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image segmentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread applicability and impact to medicine and biology are hindered by computational barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The goal of this supplement award is to provide supplemental support for Aim 3 of the parent award to leverage best practices in software development and advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large-scale cohorts to build and execute custom SSM workﬂows us- ing remote scalable computational resources. To achieve this goal, we have developed a plan to enhance the design, implementation, and cloud-readiness of ShapeWorks and augmented our scientiﬁc team to add senior, experienced software engineers/developers who have extensive experience in professional programming, code refactoring, and scientiﬁc computing. This award will provide our team with the support necessary to (Aim 1) de- sign ShapeWorks as a collection of modular and reusable services, (Aim 2) decouple ShapeWorks services from explicitly encoded data sources, and (Aim 3) refactor ShapeWorks to scale efﬁciently on the cloud. All software development will be performed in adherence to software engineering practices and design principles, including coding style, documentation, and version control. The proposed efforts will be released as open-source software in a manner consistent with the principles of reproducible research and the practices of open science. Our long- term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein in addition to the parent award will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. The impact and scientiﬁc value of ShapeWorks have been recognized in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, car- diology, and orthopedics. If funded, this supplement will provide support to revise, refactor, and redeploy Shape- Works to take advantage of new cloud computing paradigms, to be robust, sustainable, scalable, and accessible to a broader community, and to address the growing need for shape modeling tools to handle large collections of clinical data and to obtain sufﬁcient statistical power for large shape studies.",ShapeWorks in the Cloud,10166337,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Source Code ', ' shape description ', ' shape analysis ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' scientific computing ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' Cloud Service ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,210000,UT-02,0.01476560393122371
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with

"Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine Understanding the state of cellular signaling systems provides insights to how cells behave under physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchy (cascade) and signals of a molecular is often compositionally encoded to control cellular processes, such as gene expression. This project aims to develop advanced deep learning models (DLMs) to simulate cellular signaling systems based on gene expression data. In last 3 years, the project has made significant progresses, but the challenges remain. Importantly, contemporary DLMs behave as “black boxes”, in that it is difficult to interpret how signals are encoded and how to interpret which signal a hidden node represent in a DLM. This black-box nature prevents researchers from gaining biological insights using DLMs, even though these models can be much superior in modeling data than other types of models in many tasks, e.g., predicting drug sensitivity of cancer cells. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop novel DLMs and innovative inference algorithms to train “interpretable” DLMs and apply them in translational research. The proposed research is innovative and of high significance in several perspectives: 1) Our novel DLMs and algorithms take advantage of big data resulting from systematic chemical/genetic perturbations of cellular signaling machinery, so that we can use the perturbation condition as side information to reveal how signals are encoded in a DLM. 2) We integrate principles of causal inference and information theory with deep learning method to make DLMs interpretable. As results, that researchers can gain mechanistic insights from such models. 3) Innovative application of interpretable DLMs will advance translational research. For example, we will train interpretable DLMs to model cellular signaling at the level of single cells and use this information investigate inter-cellular interactions among cells in tumor microenvironment to shed light on immune evasion mechanisms of cancers. We will also use information derived from interpretable DLMs to predict cancer cell drug sensitivity. We anticipate that our study will bring forth significant advances not only in deep learning methodology but also in precision medicine. This project aims to develop advance machine learning methods, referred to as deep learning models, to simulate cellular signaling systems, at both multiple cell and single cell levels. Success of these models will enable researchers to investigate cellular behaviors under physiological and pathological condition, and such information can be used to guide therapy of cancer patients.",Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine,9972153,R01LM012011,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Information Theory ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organoids ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Yeasts ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' chemical genetics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' translational medicine ', ' Network-based ', ' cellular behavior ', ' cell behavior ', ' tumor ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' discovery learning ', ' inquiry-based instruction ', ' inquiry-based learning ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' Deep Field ', ' deep field image ', ' deep field survey ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' translational impact ', ' Immune Evasion ', ' translational model ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,309622,PA-18,0.009895227032479328
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications.

"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10023935,U24EB029011,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Licensing ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' medical implant ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape description ', ' shape analysis ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' clinical investigation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,256578,UT-02,0.017727522318913468

"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['treatment risk ', ' realtime image ', ' real-time images ', ' Visualization ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fluorescein Angiography ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publishing ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Detachment ', ' retina detachment ', ' Retinal Neovascularization ', ' Retinopathy of Prematurity ', ' Retrolental Fibroplasia ', ' premature retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Funduscopes ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' awake ', ' diabetic ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' macular edema ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' instrument ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Devices ', ' disorder of macula lutea ', ' macula abnormality ', ' macula lutea abnormality ', ' macular disease ', ' macular disorder ', ' maculopathy ', ' disorder of macula of retina ', ' Fundus ', ' portability ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Monitor ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neovascularization ', ' neonate ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computer ', ' prototype ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' standard of care ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' arm ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' improved outcome ', ' Injections ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,OR-03,-0.009572512618153908
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,9866770,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' capsule ', ' Capsules ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Colonic Polyps ', ' colon polyp ', ' Mucinous Cystadenoma ', ' Mucinous Adenoma ', ' Mucinous Cystoma ', ' Pseudomucinous Cystadenoma ', ' Cyst ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial cyst ', ' Epidermal Cyst ', ' Epidermal Inclusion Cyst ', ' Epidermoid Cyst ', ' Horn Cyst ', ' Inclusion Cyst ', ' Keratin Cyst ', ' Keratinizing Cyst ', ' Keratinous Cyst ', ' Pilar Cyst ', ' Sebaceous Cyst ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset.

"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention.

"Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer Abstract. In cancer, body-wide FDG-PET/CT is a prime modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. Despite its paramount importance to enable precision medicine in cancer, no method is currently available for automated disease burden estimation and standardized reporting on PET/CT images regionally and globally in anatomic organs and lymph node zones within a body region or body-wide. Automated production- mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement with standardized reporting will foster cancer research discovery and will be of great interest to oncologists, radiologists/ nuclear medicine physicians, Medicare and private health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies that conduct clinical trials of new cancer therapeutics and currently rely on manual methods of response assessment. The overarching goal of this Phase I project is, therefore, to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide. The project has two aims: Aim 1: Develop, implement, and validate algorithms for disease burden estimation in thoracic cancer via FDG-PET/CT. Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate a prototype software implementing the above algorithms for disease measurement and reporting. Aim 1 will be accomplished in 3 stages: Tasks 1, 2: PET/CT image data sets which are radiologically near normal for the thoracic body region will be gathered from existing whole-body scans of 100 patients. In these data sets, 7 key anatomic organs and 5 key lymph node zones in the thorax will be delineated under expert guidance. These data will be used to build population fuzzy anatomy models following our established Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) methodology. An additional 100 whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with different types of cancer will be gathered to test our methods. Using available commercial clinical software, the PET uptake properties of lesions in organs and diseased lymph nodes in lymph node zones will be measured manually and used as reference ground truth of disease burden. Task 3: Deep learning (DL) algorithms anatomically guided by AAR will be developed to very accurately localize (but not delineate) organs and lymph node zones in PET/CT images using the models. Task 4: Novel methods based on fuzzy principles will be developed to automatically tag and quantify pathological regions (without explicitly delineating them) within located organs and nodal zones, and the accuracy of disease measurement will be evaluated (Task 5). Aim 2 will be accomplished by incorporating the disease measurement methodology into a prototype software named AAR-DQ (Tasks 6, 7) based on our earlier software platform CAVASS. AAR-DQ will report disease burden in a hierarchical manner – (i) at the body-region level; (ii) at each organ/ lymph node zone level; (ii) at each lesion/ lymph node level. Expected milestones. Aim 1: AAR-DQ disease measurement not to deviate more than 10% from clinical ground truth measurement. Aim 2: Disease measurement/ reporting in under 5 minutes per patient PET/CT study. Automated production-mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement has numerous potential applications in cancer and other diseases and has considerable commercial potential. The overarching goal of this Phase I STTR project is to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body

"Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models Project Summary/Abstract The number of practicing pathologists around the world is expected to decrease by as much as 30% over the next two decades, with some of the world’s poorest countries having a ratio of only one pathologist to many hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, the diagnostic caseload that requires their expertise in clinical trials and hospital settings will continue to grow. The digitization of pathology data, coupled with the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing and scoring the data, provides exciting opportunities to make the field of pathology more efficient and scalable, even as the workforce continues to evolve. Deep learning in particular provides the potential to enhance the interpretation of medical images by improving the detection of image-based biomarkers for a broad range of diseases. Image interpretation plays an important role in patient eligibility and endpoint determination during the course of clinical trials. For patients with ulcerative colitis, the development of trained and reliable algorithms that can help pathologists identify disease progression and response to treatment in a timely and effective manner can provide benefit in two important ways. First, it will help to ensure that the most appropriate score for histological disease severity is being assigned to each image using the Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) or similar grading scale. Second, it will support a triage process by which images known to contain non- healthy tissues can be prioritized for earlier assessment. Through a unique partnership between Azavea, a geospatial technology and machine learning firm, and Robarts, a clinical trials organization, the proposed research will begin to address these needs by developing deep learning algorithms for histopathology digital image analysis, testing them on machine-readable annotations of medical imagery from previous clinical studies, and exposing them through a metadata- searchable interface that will enable the images to be categorized and quickly accessed by pathologists and others to support reader training and increase communication between multiple readers and sites. In so doing, it will not only help streamline the evaluation of new ulcerative colitis treatments that rely heavily on the image interpretation process, but also provide the foundation for the identification of additional components present in other gastrointestinal disease indications in the future. Project Narrative The proposed research will contribute critical new insights on the reliability, sensitivity, and practicality of machine learning to support gastrointestinal disease detection and evaluation in a clinical trials setting. In pathology, where manual interpretation of images using a microscope has remained relatively unchanged for decades, machine learning provides particular potential to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses by reducing the subjectivity that is often inherent in the process.",Advancing Ulcerative Colitis Monitoring with Deep Learning Models,10081185,R43EB030441,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Endoscopy ', ' endoscopic imaging ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Services ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Histopathology ', ' Speed ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' End Point Determination ', ' Endpoint Determination ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reader ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Coupled ', ' prototype ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' learning network ', ' Learning Skill ', ' imaging-based detection ', ' imaging-based disease detection ', ' imaging detection ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,"AZAVEA, INC",R43,2020,150000,PA-03,0.021098977887326568
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Calcium ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Catheterization ', ' Cathetergram ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stents ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Photons ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' attenuation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Reader ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Myocardial ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' time use ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized decision ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' Injections ', ' deep learning ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,CA-28,-0.022561942200926857
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,9878810,R01CA237269,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' Communication ', ' Conceptions ', ' Consultations ', ' Curiosities ', ' Due Process ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Individuality ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' satisfaction ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' HNC patient ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' arm ', ' Systems Development ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,490133,TX-30,0.03392116288517783
"Development of Deep Neural Networks for Automated Detection of Cancer Metastases in Staging Laparoscopy Images SUMMARY For patients who undergo operative resections for gastrointestinal cancers, treatment selection fundamentally relies on the result of intra-operative assessment of the extent of the underlying cancer (i.e. staging). Specifically, the absence or presence of distant metastases dictates the role of operative treatment, chemotherapy, and radiation. However, the accuracy of operative staging (i.e. staging laparoscopy) is limited resulting in “under-staging” in up to 30% of these patients adversely affecting their cancer treatment. While operative “under-staging” is thought to equally affect many other malignancies, the cause is believed to arise from the inability of a conventional operative exam to reliably differentiate benign from metastatic lesions. Recent results demonstrated that expert surgeons on average misidentify 36±19% of grossly visible metastases questioning the accuracy of a human examiner.  Our long-term goal is to significantly improve the accuracy of operative staging laparoscopy in patients with gastrointestinal cancers by enhancing its capability to detect metastases through means of machine learning. To achieve this goal, we will use existing videos from staging laparoscopies and abstract images of peritoneal lesions that underwent biopsy (i.e. ground truth) as part of routine care (Aim 1). These images will then be used for the development of an automated classification system. The first step of developing the classification system involves training of a deep neural network with weak supervision that will allow for automated segmentation of lesions from their surrounding background (Aim 2). The second step will extract feature vectors from the lesions segmented in Aim 2 providing information for classification. The feature vectors will be extracted by two parallel processes: unsupervised deep learning and extraction of expert-selected features. The resulting feature vectors will be used to train a model allowing the classification (benign vs. metastasis) of any peritoneal lesion (Aim 3).  The results of this study are expected to provide material for future improvements / modifications of the proposed deep learning classification system as well as the foundation for future development of an automated surgical guidance system designed to help surgeons reliably identify metastases. Relevance: This study will establish a robust, yet simple method to improve the staging accuracy of standard laparoscopy via the detection of peritoneal metastases otherwise missed by human examiners. This will significantly improve cancer care through better treatment allocation. Further, it is expected that the detection of currently missed metastases will have a major impact on staging and treatment algorithms for a variety of cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE During operations to treat gastrointestinal cancers, disease spread to other sites (i.e. metastases) is not recognized in a significant proportion of patients adversely affecting their cancer care. The proposed study will utilize artificial intelligence computer algorithms that will allow for automated identification and classification of such metastases.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9936447,R01EB028591,"['Affect ', ' Alkalies ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium Oxalate ', ' calcium salt Ethanedioic acid ', ' calcium phosphate ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minerals ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Uric Acid ', ' Trioxopurine ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urolith ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Research Subjects ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Ureteroscopy ', ' Surface ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Cost Efficient Management ', ' Cost Effective Management ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' risk minimization ', ' clinical investigation ', ' photon detection ', ' single photon detector ', ' photon-counting detector ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357486,MN-01,0.019069311360071225
"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks).

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges.

"An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project, we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits. Project Narrative Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image datasets is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focuses on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' radiologist ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Reader ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Step retraining ', ' Step training ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' data acquisition ', ' data space ', ' patient population ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,NY-12,0.024084764318451
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management. This project will improve patient care by applying powerful deep learning techniques to provide clinicians with critical decision support information to more accurately detect glaucoma, reveal associations between structure and visual function, and predict glaucoma progression.",Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,10055661,K99EY030942,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' South Korea ', ' Republic of Korea ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Standardization ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Supervision ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' tomography ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' POAG ', ' Primary Open Angle Glaucoma ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' macular ', ' macula ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' legally blind ', ' RNFL ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' clinical care ', ' standard measure ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,117347,CA-52,0.002540007510996332
