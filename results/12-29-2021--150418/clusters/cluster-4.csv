"Statistical Methods for Predicting Sucicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior. This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls. Relevance: Suicide causes over 30,000 deaths annually in the USA, and the number of suicide attempts is thought to be at least several times that. The aim of this study is to develop and compare efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of future suicide attempts based on demographic, clinical and biological data tor the use of health professionals so that patients at risk for suicide can be identified and treated in advance.           ",Statistical Methods for Predicting Sucicide Attempt,7880713,K25MH074068,"['Crying ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Gene Expression ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' receptor binding ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' suicide model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' suicidal act ', ' suicide act ', ' suicide victim ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K25,2010,129740,NY-13,0.3864836146045613
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments.

"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups).

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts.

"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior.

"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable

"Addressing Suicide Research Gaps: Understanding Mortality Outcomes in the Mid-Atlantic Region  PROJECTSUMMARY Data linkage offers the potential to improve suicide risk surveillance as well as evaluate and enhance suicide prevention approaches. Data linkage could also allow for the identification of novel predictors or combinations of predictors to improve precision medicine efforts. The ability to access and analyze health care data has expanded dramatically in the past decade. The goal of this application is to leverage data from multiple sources including hospital discharges, insurance claims, death investigations, health information exchanges, and administrative data (e.g., civil status, employment status, legal system involvement, neighborhood characteristics, unemployment, gun ownership, arrests and incarceration). Aggregating these data systems will allow for novel secondary data analyses, which will enhance our understanding of risk and protective processes on suicide death in the Mid-Atlantic region. The aims of this project include identifying and merging existing clinical data sources (e.g., medical examiner, claims, hospital discharges), geo-level data sources and other clinical data (e.g., built environment, electronic health records), and aggregated administrative data (e.g., school, incarceration, gun ownership). Our team will develop predictive models using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. These models will be enhanced using spatial algorithms to detect the geo-clustering of suicide. The generalizability of data sources and analytic methods will be tested in the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia) to evaluate data availability, quality and data linkage feasibility. The methods of this project will be shared as a resource with other states and regions to establish a similar analytics framework to advance suicide prevention. Our team will develop national guidelines and technical support materials to facilitate data linkage and analysis based on common data sources available in most states. The project will offer essential benchmarks and measures for providers and payers to reduce suicide events in their systems.  PUBLICHEALTHRELEVANCE Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Over 44,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2015 and rates have increased 24% since 1999.

"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9579491,U01MH116923,"['Academic

"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9593921,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Glean ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' success ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' ESTs ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' suicidal youth ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,797747,PA-18,0.2999904366366395
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9489301,R01MH085651,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' falls ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' BOLD response ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavioral economics ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,482739,PA-18,0.45274665099170314
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9593994,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' process reproducibility ', ' process repeatability ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,547151,MA-08,0.3524217199444176

The overall goal is to leverage a collaborative network of tribal leaders, investigators, interventionalists, service providers and service users in the Southwest region to reduce suicide in American Indian youth ages 10-24. An administrative supplement is requested in order to build on our existing data collection platform to be more scalable and efficient when used across tribal settings. In collaboration with colleagues at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, we will set up the data collection platform to incorporate additional sites and capitalize on preliminary machine learning work to create easily interpretable risk flags that can help case-managers prioritize cases to reach and connect to care. This work will contribute to a better understanding of how to scale community based m-health platforms for use across diverse settings and how to operationalize and implement machine learning algorithms to help improve care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By strengthening the existing m-health suicide surveillance and case-management platform in the parent grant, these supplementary activities will pave the way for scale-up and enhancement of the system with novel risk detection methods across tribal settings. This supplement will provide valuable knowledge about how to extend the reach of real-world data collection system and services, including the ability to incorporate computational modeling and data analytics in existing workflows, research that is directly in line with key research priorities (4.1.A) for NIMH’s strategic objective 4.",Enhancing and extending the reach of suicide surveillance in tribal communities,9707084,U19MH113136,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Collection ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Case Management ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Site ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' outreach ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Detection ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal leader ', ' scale up ', ' parent grant ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' Data Analytics ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U19,2018,174538,MD-07,0.19793986984553372
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9543193,R01MH116652,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computers ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk ', ' Shame ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' ideation ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' impression ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicidal individual ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' recruit ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,798597,PA-18,0.20751563822092453
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9593182,R01MH117559,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' biotherapy ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biological treatment ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Health ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Alcoholic Liver Diseases ', ' ethanol-mediated liver injury ', ' ethanol-mediated liver dysfunction ', ' ethanol-induced liver dysfunction ', ' ethanol-induced liver disease ', ' ethanol-induced hepatic dysfunction ', ' ethanol induced liver injury ', ' ethanol induced liver disorder ', ' ethanol induced hepatic injury ', ' alcoholic liver injury ', ' alcohol-mediated liver injury ', ' alcohol-mediated liver dysfunction ', ' alcohol-induced liver dysfunction ', ' alcohol-induced liver disease ', ' alcohol-induced hepatic dysfunction ', ' alcohol induced liver injury ', ' alcohol induced liver disorder ', ' alcohol induced hepatic injury ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mining ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poisoning ', ' poisoned ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Rural Community ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Coin ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multimodality ', ' public health emergency ', ' illicit drug use ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' secondary analysis ', ' protective factors ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466099,NC-04,0.11455051143175089
"Suicide Death Among Older Adults Receiving Residential Long-term Care Project Summary/Abstract  Suicide is among the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. and suicide risk increases substantially after age 65. Nearly 70% of individuals currently 65 years old will require long-term care during the remainder of their lives. The nation's 15,000 nursing homes are an important setting providing residential post-acute and long-term care to over 3 million older and disabled Americans every year, and the nation's 30,000 assisted living facilities provided a home to about 800,000 elders during 2013-14. Residents in the 2 types of long-term care facilities are often socially isolated, physically and cognitively disabled, and diagnosed with multiple mental and medical conditions, all of which are associated with suicide in older adults. As a result, they may show elevated risk taking their own lives compared to community-living elders despite the fact that long-term care facilities are able to monitor closely the daily activities of their residents. However, the actual suicide risk among these residents is largely unknown. Moreover, it is expected that organizational characteristics and overall ability of long-term care facilities to provide safe and high quality of care play an important role in shaping the risk of suicide for residents at different points of care. However, empirical evidence on these questions is extremely limited. This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, estimate suicide risk for nursing home residents at different points of care using longitudinal resident assessment records, and determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate. Organizational characteristics will be measured by nursing home structural factors (e.g. profit status), overall quality of care (e.g. measured by nurse staffing level), and organizational-level patient safety culture. This project will link the longitudinal National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and National Death Index (NDI) files to nursing home Minimum Data Sets (MDS) and Medicare beneficiary data, as well as other facility and state policy files. These data will be used to model resident risk for suicide death using cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods, quantify the variations in risk-adjusted suicide death rates at different levels (i.e. facility, region, and state levels), and test the hypotheses regarding organizational and policy impacts on suicide death. The information generated in this project will contribute to the knowledge of suicide burdens among the most vulnerable elders in need of residential long-term care. The knowledge gained will inform future organizational- and policy-level interventions to prevent suicide among elders receiving long-term care. Project Narrative This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, and to determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate.

"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,9834058,F31MH120973,"['Affect ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foster Home Care ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' foster care ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' child protective service ', ' child protection services ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' abuse neglect ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' stem ', ' service intervention ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' protective factors ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,MD-07,0.3246399801437842
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups).

"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,9774940,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicide model ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2019,224998,IL-07,0.40434967061424426
"Smartphone-based digital phenotyping to detect high-risk affect states in body dysmorphic disorder Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with extremely high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the critical importance of risk detection in BDD. Negative affect states - particularly anxiety and shame - are well-documented risk factors for suicide and substance use in BDD, offering clear targets for risk detection and intervention. This K23 aims to develop and validate unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of anxiety, shame, and general negative affect states in BDD, using smartphone-based digital phenotyping. Passive (i.e., unobtrusive) smartphone measurement of negative affect states will be based on GPS, accelerometer, and communication logs, used to detect behavioral features of anxiety (avoidance, rituals), shame (social withdrawal, isolation), and general negative affect (aggregated avoidance, rituals, withdrawal, and isolation features). We will collect passive and active (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) smartphone data in 85 adults with BDD and will use EMA ratings of negative affect as outcomes, to build and validate predictive statistical models from passive data. We will also test the hypotheses that passive smartphone measures of negative affect states can significantly predict next-day suicidal ideation and substance use in BDD, above and beyond common clinical indices of risk. This project synthesizes the Candidate’s expertise in emotion-based risk for suicide in BDD with her experience conducting smartphone research. Building from this foundation, this K23 will provide critical new training in key areas to launch the Candidate’s independent research career: (1) digital phenotyping, including statistical learning and longitudinal analysis; (2) EMA methods; (3) assessment of suicide and substance use; (4) career development, including R01 writing; and (5) ethics of technology-based suicide and substance use research. Training goals will be accomplished with stellar mentorship and institutional support at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sabine Wilhelm, a leader in BDD and clinical research, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, an expert in digital phenotyping and its statistical approaches, and Dr. Michael Armey, an expert in EMA research of emotions and suicide, will serve as co-mentors. Complementary guidance in EMA and substance use will be provided by the advisory team: Drs. Bettina Hoeppner and A. Eden Evins. In line with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 will yield scalable, unobtrusive tools to detect acute, modifiable risk factors for suicide and substance use in a high-risk population. Moreover, negative affect states are transdiagnostic risk factors. As a next step to this proof-of- concept K23, the Candidate will apply for an R01 to further validate passive mobile detection of negative affect states and their ability to predict risk transdiagnostically. This program of research can enable (1) personalized just-in-time interventions targeting high-risk affect states, to reduce suicide and substance use; (2) unobtrusive monitoring of changes in risk; and (3) large-scale, ecologically-valid longitudinal research of risk processes. Project Narrative Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with extremely high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the importance of accurate, real-time risk detection in BDD. This study aims to use smartphone-based digital phenotyping to develop and validate unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of key risk factors for suicide and substance misuse in BDD: negative affect states.

"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9835007,F31MH121039,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Sweden ', ' Translating ', ' World Health Organization ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' suicidal ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' translational pipeline ', ' translational spectrum ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2019,45016,IN-09,0.2369402884861715
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9743863,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Future ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Glean ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' success ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' ESTs ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' child depression ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,720889,PA-18,0.2999904366366395
"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable

"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework

"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,9638873,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' ER nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ED Nursing ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' health care economics ', ' healthcare economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical spine ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,843783,MA-02,0.22422473148191177
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9716663,R01MH116652,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Risk ', ' Shame ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' ideation ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' impression ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal individual ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' recruit ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,723673,PA-18,0.20751563822092453
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young

"Predictive modeling: the role of opioid use in suicide risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Suicide deaths and opioid-related overdose deaths have both been increasing in recent years. These two public health crises have substantial overlap: our preliminary work suggests that between 22% and 37% of opioid-related overdoses are suicides or suicide attempts. Healthcare settings are ideal places to intervene to prevent suicides, however clinicians need better tools to recognize the patients at greatest risk. We developed models that predict risk of suicide attempt or death with 83% to 86% accuracy. However, these models do not include important opioid-related variables. In a parallel body of work, we developed algorithms based on coded electronic health record (EHR) data to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides. The proposed project integrates these two existing lines of research. Our suicide risk prediction dataset includes seven large healthcare systems and approximately 20 million visits by 3 million patients; it is currently being expanded to include additional outcomes and visits through 2016, and additional predictors, however inclusion of opioid-related variables was not part of the funded supplement. In the proposed study, we will determine whether including variables related to illicit and prescribed opioid use, opioid use disorder, discontinuation or significant dose reductions of prescription opioids, or prior non-fatal opioid-related overdoses improves predictions of suicide attempts or death within 90 days following an outpatient healthcare visit. We will also develop models that specifically predict opioid- related suicide attempts and deaths in the sample as a whole and among people prescribed opioid medications, and determine if the predictors of opioid-related suicide attempts or deaths are consistent for men and women. The goal of the proposed work is to maximize the performance of our models in order to create the best available tools for clinicians to help reduce future suicides.

"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time.

"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,9821134,K23MH118361,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alaska ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Empathy ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Idaho ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Motivation ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Savings ', ' Science ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' trauma centers ', ' trauma units ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' County ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' technological innovation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Trauma Nursing ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' injured ', ' computerized ', ' Information Technology ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' Health behavior change ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' task analysis ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trauma care ', ' screening ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Trauma patient ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' feasibility trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,154695,WA-07,0.29292271968256034
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9773224,U01MH116923,"['Academic

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington.

"Using claims data to study the association between Alzheimer's disease and suicidal behaviors PROJECT ABSTRACT Given that dementia represents the major cause of loss of autonomy in older adults, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) could represent a critical moment that increases the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA). However, despite significant research progress in the past decade, it remains unclear if there are “clusters” of patients with ADRD who are at an increased risk for suicide, and how utilization of healthcare services, or the lack thereof, might be associated with SI/SA rates.

"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time.

"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10104283,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,769521,NC-04,0.4154953571979116
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young

"Predictive modeling: the role of opioid use in suicide risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Suicide deaths and opioid-related overdose deaths have both been increasing in recent years. These two public health crises have substantial overlap: our preliminary work suggests that between 22% and 37% of opioid-related overdoses are suicides or suicide attempts. Healthcare settings are ideal places to intervene to prevent suicides, however clinicians need better tools to recognize the patients at greatest risk. We developed models that predict risk of suicide attempt or death with 83% to 86% accuracy. However, these models do not include important opioid-related variables. In a parallel body of work, we developed algorithms based on coded electronic health record (EHR) data to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides. The proposed project integrates these two existing lines of research. Our suicide risk prediction dataset includes seven large healthcare systems and approximately 20 million visits by 3 million patients; it is currently being expanded to include additional outcomes and visits through 2016, and additional predictors, however inclusion of opioid-related variables was not part of the funded supplement. In the proposed study, we will determine whether including variables related to illicit and prescribed opioid use, opioid use disorder, discontinuation or significant dose reductions of prescription opioids, or prior non-fatal opioid-related overdoses improves predictions of suicide attempts or death within 90 days following an outpatient healthcare visit. We will also develop models that specifically predict opioid- related suicide attempts and deaths in the sample as a whole and among people prescribed opioid medications, and determine if the predictors of opioid-related suicide attempts or deaths are consistent for men and women. The goal of the proposed work is to maximize the performance of our models in order to create the best available tools for clinicians to help reduce future suicides. We have an established collaboration with the largest national EHR vendor and are working to develop an EHR-based, point-of-care clinical tool to predict suicide attempts and deaths based on our research findings. This work will therefore have a direct impact on clinical practice by providing clinicians with an efficient, evidence-based tool to evaluate suicide risk. The work will also provide critical data on understudied opioid-related predictors and moderators of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicides and opioid-related overdoses have many overlapping risk factors, and both have been increasing over the past decade, causing concern that many overdose deaths may actually be suicides. We developed robust models to predict suicide attempts and deaths following outpatient healthcare visits. We also developed algorithms to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides.

"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success

"Positive and Negative Valence Systems Underlying Suicide in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a major public health concern in adolescents and the second leading cause of death in this age group, highlighting the need to investigate suicide in adolescents. The two most prominent risk factors for completed suicide in youth are a past suicide attempt and a diagnosis of a depressive episode, each independently representing a 10- to 30-fold increased risk for completed suicide. However, while over 80% of suicidal youth present with depressive symptoms at the time of the attempt, only 30% of depressed youth will ever attempt suicide. These data suggest that depressed adolescents with prior suicide attempts represent a distinct neurobiological subgroup. However, at present, we have no biomarkers to identify those depressed youth who will engage in suicidal behavior. This proposal addresses this concern. Our proposed model is: (1) anhedonia is associated with heightened suicidal risk in depressed youth; (2) both positive valence (PVS) deficits (reward expectancy, attainment, positive prediction error) and negative valence (NVS) hyperactivity (negative prediction error, pain avoidance) contribute to anhedonia and underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth; (3) the habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, plays a key role in PVS/NVS processes by inhibiting reward signaling in response to pain and loss; and (4) recent advances in high-resolution MRI address prior technical constraints in studying small structures such as the Hb. These advances now allow us to study the neuronal circuitry underlying PVS and NVS in a neuroanatomically rigorous framework. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia, not irritability, was associated with suicidality among depressed youth. Similarly, we found that both anhedonia and entrapment were independently associated with suicidality in acutely suicidal hospitalized individuals. We also developed the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks and identified brain function during reward anticipation, attainment, and positive and negative prediction errors. Notably, both RPET and a thermal pain task elicited measurable Hb activation. Additionally, utilizing an optimized segmentation and seeding approach, we mapped Hb intrinsic functional connectivity in adults and in adolescents with psychiatric symptoms. Building upon our work, we propose a tightly integrative study to test the overall hypothesis that both PVS deficiency and NVS hyperactivity underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth. We will study 30 suicidal and 30 non-suicidal depressed adolescents, ages 12-17, group matched for age, sex, and handedness. All will have comprehensive clinical evaluations (diagnoses, behavioral measures, computerized reward task). Neuroimaging studies will include structural MRI, resting-state and task fMRI (RFT, RPET, thermal pain). Machine learning algorithms will be used to examine which PVS/NVS processes predict suicidal behavior in depressed youth.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to suicide in adolescent depression, the cohort with the highest suicidal risk in youth. Using novel neuroimaging and modelling approaches, we will test the overall hypothesis that neural processes underlying both positive valence deficiency and negative valance hyperactivity play a key role in suicidal behavior in adolescent depression.

"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,9859704,R01MH121455,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Country ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' clinical risk ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' genetic architecture ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,561236,TN-05,0.36959056503338966
"Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients. PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT). PROJECT ABSTRACT Opioid misuse and its associated risks of suicide is a national public health emergency. Current estimates suggest that chronic pain impacts nearly half of Veterans, and studies have shown that people who experience chronic pain are at increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including suicide and opioid overdose. Although multiple national initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have attempted to decrease the number of veterans with opioid prescriptions for pain management, these efforts focus on analyzing VA data only. Given that many Veterans receive care and treatment from non-VA community clinics and medical centers, it is imperative to study suicide or accidental overdose risk amongst Veterans with pain disorders by analyzing both VA and non-VA data.

"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents. This research program aims to identify modifiable risk factors, including social media use and sleep disruption, for adolescent suicide risk, and ultimately, contribute to the development of interventions that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time to prevent suicide.",The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study,10054721,K01MH121584,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Attenuated ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' ideation ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' sleep onset ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Affective ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' clinically actionable ', ' social media ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' digital media ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,58402,PA-18,0.16209549884495353
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9910447,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Institutes ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Glean ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' suicidal youth ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' high risk ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,721582,PA-18,0.2999904366366395
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9901631,R01MH116652,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computers ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk ', ' Shame ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' impression ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicidal individual ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' recruit ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' classification algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,720691,PA-18,0.20751563822092453
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,9885577,R21MH121886,"['Bereavement ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Future ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide model ', ' expressive writing therapy ', ' expressive writing ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal individual ', ' loved ones ', ' primary outcome ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' informal support ', ' web-based tool ', ' recruit ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2020,248112,NY-12,0.3398710749824983
"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10027263,R01MH123489,"['Accounting ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Hand ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Population Control ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' data resource ', ' early life stress ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,738338,UT-02,0.4307877922925757
"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10055559,K01MH121580,"['psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' prophylactic ', ' cell type ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Early identification ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' epigenomics ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' biosignature ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' methylome ', ' methylation marker ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' BeadChip ', ' bead chip ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' marker identification ', ' biomarker identification ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' methylomics ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2020,174843,TX-09,0.2816704300244419
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,10019729,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide model ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' Risk stratification ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2020,752198,IL-07,0.40434967061424426
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9982129,U01MH116923,"['Academic

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington.

"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. Analyses will examine overall effect of buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicide attempt or death, heterogeneity of effects in patient subgroups, and specificity of effects to buprenorphine vs other medications.",Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior,10136935,U19MH121738,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Overdose ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' World Health ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' chronic pain ', ' analytical method ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Withdrawal ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' health record ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' data resource ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid overdose ', ' illicit opiate ', ' illicit opioid ', ' buprenorphine treatment ', ' risk prediction model ', ' social factors ', ' opioid tapering ', ' ']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U19,2020,514616,CA-13,0.1629353038536067
"Improving the Identification and Management of Suicide Risk among Patients Using Prescription Opioids ABSTRACT The opioid epidemic in the US, coupled with emerging data on the association between opioid use and suicidal behavior, highlights the urgent need for research that identifies patients at greatest risk and provides strategies to mitigate this risk. However, the development of risk algorithms that provide clinical guidance for providers with patients using opioids who may have underlying mental disorders or comorbid diagnoses has been nonexistent. Recent work has demonstrated the compelling need for a better understanding of, and clinical decision support tools to address, suicide risk among prescription opioid drug users. The proposed study provides an opportunity to address gaps in both the identification and clinical management of suicide risk in patients using prescription opioids. We propose to use transfer learning approaches to identify the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with elevated risk of suicidal behavior among prescription opioid users; to develop clinical phenotypes of patients with higher risk of suicidal behavior associated with prescription opioids, and to incorporate these phenotypes in a clinical decision support platform that can be used for identification and intervention at the point of care; and to conduct a pilot study implementing and evaluating the impact of the clinical decision support platform in the existing clinical workflow in 3 diverse clinical settings. Our approach is specifically designed to address the incomplete picture of patient risk in existing models due to the fragmentation of clinical care across settings. We do this by developing algorithms that can statistically “borrow” information from more comprehensive patient datasets and apply it to more limited datasets in a particular healthcare setting. The proposed work will draw on comprehensive clinical data from a mature health information exchange containing more than 2.3 million patients across the spectrum of clinical care to develop a statistically robust method to measure suicide risk associated with prescription opioid use. The clinical decision support tool developed under this proposal will provide a generalizable platform that could be extended to other opioid related risks, e.g., OUD and overdose. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients' behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients using prescription opioids who are at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide and prescription opioid use are two of the most serious public health problems facing the United States.

"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9981424,F31MH121039,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Sweden ', ' Translating ', ' World Health Organization ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' suicidal ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' translational spectrum ', ' translational pipeline ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2020,45520,IN-09,0.2369402884861715
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,9985286,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide model ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' Risk stratification ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2020,97195,IL-07,0.40434967061424426
"Suicide Prediction and Prevention for People at Risk for Opioid Use Disorder Title: Reducing Stigma toward People with Opioid Use Disorder among Primary Care Clinicians Abstract: This study integrates the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) suicide risk models into Opioid Wizard, an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) to identify and treat patients at high risk of or identified with opioid use disorder (OUD) or overdose. In both intervention and control clinics, suicide risk scores will be calculated for all Opioid Wizard-eligible patients and relevant EHR data to inform analyses will be archived. In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will alert primary care clinicians (PCCs) to Opioid Wizard-eligible patients who are at increased risk of suicide and coach them through use of the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (CSSRS), a structured tool in the EHR that will help PCCs assess immediate suicide risk. Based on the resulting CSSRS score, Opioid Wizard will provide EHR links for risk-based referrals and follow-up recommendations, including care as usual, safety plan completion, routine or emergent referral to behavioral health, or transportation to the emergency department (ED) for further assessment. Primary outcome measures include completion of CSSRS assessments for at-risk patients and patient engagement in outpatient mental health care.     Modified Specific Aims Section Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of Opioid Wizard + Suicide Risk Prediction on suicide assessment process measures.  H1: Opioid Wizard-eligible patients (patients with OUD or at elevated risk of OUD/overdose) with elevated suicide risk in intervention clinics will have higher rates of completed CSSRS assessments than similar patients in control clinics.    Aim 2. Examine the impact of Opioid Wizard + Suicide Risk Prediction on patient engagement in mental health care.  H2: Opioid Wizard-eligible patients with elevated suicide risk in intervention clinics will have higher rates of engagement in their outpatient mental health care than similar patients in control clinics. Modified Public Health Relevance Section Two public health issues of paramount importance -- suicide and opioid overdose -- have substantial overlap. Depression and other mental health conditions increase the risk of both opioid use disorder (OUD) and suicide, and people with OUD are more likely to have depression and other mental health conditions. In fact, the risk of both suicide and opioid overdose is likely highest in those with both OUD and mental health diagnoses. More than 48,000 people died of suicide and 46,000 of an opioid overdose in the US in 2018, and over 40% of suicide and overdose deaths involved opioids. Ultimately, people with OUD are 13 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.     OUD and opioid misuse are associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, but distinguishing intentional and unintentional overdoses is complicated. The proportion of opioid-overdose deaths that are suicides is likely considerable and underestimated, as it is challenging to classify overdoses according to intent. Furthermore, intentionality of overdose is likely dimensional, rather than categorical, with many overdoses not fully intentional or unintentional. Suicide deaths and overdose deaths share common risk factors, and while historically most overdoses have been thought to be unintentional, more recent evidence suggests that a significant proportion – estimated to be 20 to 30% - are intentional.    The US Preventative Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal screening for suicide risk, but this is not to discourage screening at-risk populations, such as people with or at high risk for OUD or opioid overdose. A recent commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine states that improved screening for suicide risk along with rapid access to treatment is critical to prevent opioid-related suicide deaths in patients with OUD. Ultimately, people with OUD should be targeted for prevention of both suicide and opioid overdose, recognizing that mental health conditions in this population will further increase risk. To that end, this ancillary study, which will help primary care clinicians (PCCs) both identify people at risk for OUD/opioid overdose and a subset at increased risk of suicide, is particularly timely and important. In addition to guiding PCCs through structured assessment of suicide risk and providing decision support for recognition and treatment of depression, our study’s potential to improve access to medications for OUD is also thought to reduce rates of intentional (and unintentional) overdose.",Suicide Prediction and Prevention for People at Risk for Opioid Use

"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,9851004,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic analysis ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Blinded ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,831964,MA-02,0.22422473148191177
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools. Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk.",Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health,10100989,R01MH125027,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Guns ', ' gun ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Marital Status ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Source ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Inferior ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' health record ', ' drinking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' next generation ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' social health determinants ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' deep learning ', ' random forest ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2020,841366,MA-03,0.3868524713457582
"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW. The study aims to achieve a number of outcomes: (1) Acquire refreshed data from all existing MSDW data sources; (2) Use the wide array of data sources stored in MSDW to advance the prediction of suicide mortality, while controlling for data quality and potential model bias; (3) Explore various uses cases of the MSDW such as unsupervised clustering of suicide mortality cases; and, (4) Collaborate with external investigators to validate the MSDW-derived predictive models of suicide death. ❖ PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Close to 48,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2017 and rates have increased 33% since 1999.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia ABSTRACT: Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research  Suicide is among the top leading causes of death in the US; individuals with schizophrenia (Sz) have a lifetime risk of more than tenfold that of the general population. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) are prevalent also in clinical risk states for schizophrenia, in teens and young adults at increased clinical high risk (CHR) for Sz and related psychotic disorders, based on attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS). In CHR cohorts, lifetime prevalence is ~77% for suicidal ideation and ~20% for suicidal behavior and attempts. Base rates for suicide by death after ascertainment is ~1% within a few years. Despite the clear public health problem of SIB in CHR teens and young adults, there is a clear gap in our understanding of their associated mechanisms and neural substrates, and their demographic, symptom and clinical correlates. It is important to gain a better understanding of SIB in CHR individuals in order to extend prevention efforts for CHR individuals beyond prevention of psychosis and poor functional outcome to include suicide prevention as well.  This proposal is an administrative supplement submitted in response to NOT-MH-19-026 Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research, for the parent R01 of “Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia” (end 2021). It capitalizes on the parent R01's prospective cohort that includes data across multiple levels of analysis, including behavior (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuits (brain structure and function), as well as data on SIB collected for purposes of safety, using the PhenX toolkit measure of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Therefore, this supplement does not entail the addition of any new measures. It is expected there will be data on 90 CHR, 25 Sz, and 25 healthy individuals by mid-2020 amenable for analysis (preliminary data now includes 30 CHR).  This supplement adds a new specific aim relevant to suicide risk, namely to identify linguistic/cognitive biomarkers, symptom/demographic correlates and neural substrates of C-SSRS SIB in CHR individuals using advanced analytic methods, including natural language processing, machine learning, penalized regression, and sparse modeling. The work proposed is within the scope of the parent R01 as it entails the application of similar advanced analytic methods to the same dataset, to understand mechanisms of key clinical features in a young at-risk cohort (parent R01: psychosis risk: supplement: suicide risk). It is hypothesized that SIB will be associated in CHR individuals with greater use of words with negative emotional content and greater self-focus in language (use of personal pronouns), social cognitive deficits, depression, motivational deficits, gray matter reduction and abnormal resting connectivity. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) is prevalent in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, including during putative prodromal stages, in teens and young adults at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis; however, little is known about the mechanisms and neural substrates that underlie SIB in at-risk youths. This proposal for an administrative supplement capitalizes on a large prospective CHR cohort study that has data available across behavioral (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuit-based (brain structure and function) levels, as well as safety data on SIB from a measure in the PhenX toolkit. It employs advanced analytic methods and automated language analysis to gain a better understanding of SIB in psychosis risk states, key for development of suicide prevention efforts in this risk group of young people.",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9941435,R01MH107558,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Grant ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Inferior ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' visual processing ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' auditory processing ', ' recruit ', ' automated analysis ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,150193,NY-13,0.2562038203882406
"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework

"Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data Summary. Suicide in youths is a growing health concern, yet current clinical practice falls short of timely identifying youths at risk for suicide attempt (SA). The overarching aim of this research is to use data driven machine learning methods to facilitate primary prevention of youth SAs in primary care pediatric settings. Clinical guidelines recommend screening for depression, considered a proxy for suicide risk, from age 12 in pediatric setting. The proposed study aims at identification of variables (features) that can be collected by early adolescence, and contribute to prediction of SA in later adolescence. This study will leverage the effort that has been invested in previous projects: a study using electronic health records (EHR) to predict SAs and deaths in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) hospitals; and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that included comprehensive phenotyping of ~9,500 youths. These previous efforts will be integrated to develop and optimize SA prediction in youth from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) network, from which we have data on ~40,000 who were screened for a history of SA between the years 2014-2018 (n~1500). First, in the CHOP dataset, we will generate predictive models based on UPMC data, test their predictive validity in CHOP youth population, and then develop, optimize, and cross validate these predictive models using CHOP EHR data as a training set (Aim 1). Second, in the PNC dataset, we will use multiple data types (demographic, behavioral, cognitive, imaging) to classify youths with suicide ideation (SI, n~750) and identify features (potentially modifiable) that are indicative of SI and may also point to potential mechanisms underlying youth SI (Aim 2). Lastly, in a subset of 936 youths (49 with SAs) with both CHOP EHR data and research PNC evaluation that was conducted at mean age 11 (T1), ~5 years before SA screening (T2), we will test the validity of models from Aims 1&2, and aim to identify data features that were collected at T1 and can improve/optimize/outperform the prediction of SAs that relies solely on EHR data (Aim 3). The proposed study relies on the expertise of a highly capable multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Barzilay (PI), child- adolescent psychiatrist experienced in suicide research and analysis of suicide related phenotypes in PNC data; Dr. Tsui (PI), an expert in machine learning who has developed predictive algorithms of SA and deaths using UPMC data; and collaborators critical for meeting study aims, Dr. Raquel Gur as the lead researcher who established the PNC, Dr. Ruben Gur who developed the PNC neurocognitive assessment tools, and Dr. Oquendo who will provide expertise in suicide prediction research. The team’s access and familiarity with CHOP EHR and PNC data resources, coupled with its interdisciplinary expertise, creates a unique opportunity to identify childhood features that can optimize later adolescent SA prediction. Expected findings can ultimately translate to real world clinical practice, be integrated in EHR, and help flag youths at risk for a SA in a pediatric setting, allowing timely identification and intervention, contributing to the mission of reducing suicide in youth. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth, and a major focus of pediatric and psychiatric research, yet teen suicide rates are on the rise. The proposed research aims to develop novel computational tools that will allow prediction of youth suicide attempts using the individual’s electronic medical record, and help identify which variables (that are currently not part of the medical record) need to be integrated in the medical record of a child in order to optimize such prediction. The findings of this project are expected to translate to clinical practice and help primary care providers timely identify youth at suicide risk and thus contribute to reducing youth suicide rates.","Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data",10038009,R21MH123916,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', '

"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,10003830,F31MH120973,"['Affect ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foster Home Care ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' foster care ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' child protection services ', ' child protective service ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' abuse neglect ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' stem ', ' service intervention ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' protective factors ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,MD-07,0.3246399801437842
"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and
