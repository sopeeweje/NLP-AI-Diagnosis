"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.

"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC. We expect that understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will open novel approaches to direct the course of future interventions and prevention strategies by controlling the infectious agent, which are the approaches now used for managing Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer.      Public Health Relevance: Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.           Narrative Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person.

"Prediction of influenza antigenic variants using a novel sparse multitask learnin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza and influenza related complication lead to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and approximately 36,000 deaths in the United States each year, and vaccination is the primary option for reducing influenza effect. A large amount of global efforts has to be made each year to identify antigenic variants and decide whether new vaccine strains are needed. Current laboratory based antigenic characterization processes are labor intensive and time consuming, and it has been the bottleneck for generating an effective influenza vaccination program. A robust method without such a laboratory characterization is demanding for rapid identification of influenza antigenic variants. This project proposes to develop a novel sparse multitask learning method in predicting influenza antigenic variants solely based on the input of protein sequences, and further to apply this method in mapping antigenic drift pathway of A/H3N2 influenza viruses and studying antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This method is based on the assumption that influenza antigenicity would be determined by certain features in hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence and tertiary structure. This assumption was well evidenced that the viruses with conserved HAs generated cross-reactions in serological reactions and also provided cross- protection in both laboratory experiments and field practices. The proposed method is novel since it combines multitask learning and sparse learning. Therefore not only this project will develop significant technology for antigenic variant screen, but also new machine learning methods. This project will facilitate vaccine strain selection since the proposed method can potentially reduce and even eliminate serological assay, one of the most labor intensive procedures, in influenza surveillance. In addition, the antigenicity specific features and the drift patterns causing influenza outbreaks to be identified in this study will enhance our understanding about antigen-antibody interaction thus enhance our knowledge in influenza immunology and serology. Furthermore, the proposed method is potentially applicable in characterizing antigenic properties of other pathogens with significant antigenic variations, for example, rotavirus. The specific aims are the following: (1) Development of a novel sparse multitask learning method in generating antigenic distance matrix using hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) data; (2) Development of a quantitative method for predicting antigenic variants in silicon; (3) Application of this method in studying seasonal influenza antigenic drift pathway and antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This nature of this study is to address a novel predictive method for measuring antigenic divergence between influenza viruses, which is critical in influenza vaccine strain selection. Thus, we are submitting this project to the broad challenge area (06) Enabling Technologies and fit for the Specific Challenge 06-GM-103: development of predictive method for molecular structure, recognition, and ligand interaction.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is to develop a novel computational method for influenza antigenic variant prediction, which is very useful in influenza vaccine strain selection.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          ",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' global health ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' Guadeloupe ', ' improved ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Learning ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Methods ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phylogeny ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Restriction fragment length polymorphism ', ' Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms Molecular Biology ', ' RFLP ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' mycobacterial ', ' Biology ', ' success ', ' family genetics ', ' DNA Insertion Elements ', ' insertion sequence ', ' insertion element ', ' Boxing ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Metric ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' DNA Typing ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' Gender ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Genomics ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' fight against ', ' genetic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' patient privacy ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' public health research ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,NY-20,0.058226811483336346
"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           ",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7907646,K25CA127524,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Chronic Hepatitis ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incidence ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Liver Fibrosis ', ' hepatic fibrosis ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Caucasians ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2010,131421,TX-14,0.03238096343436907

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  but  silence  over  the  course  of  several  weeks.  This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.  Towards  this,  we  have  assembled  a  highly  diverse  and  collaborative  team  including  microbiologists,  aerobiologists,  bioinformaticians,  mathematicians/statisticians,  veterinarians,  veterinary  pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          ",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8077374,K01AI079162,"['Pennsylvania ', ' Parasites ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Disease Vectors ', ' Vector (Infectious Agent) ', ' Rural ', ' Capital ', ' Americas ', ' Probability ', ' Running ', ' Housing ', ' Solutions ', ' vector ', ' chemotherapy ', ' South America ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Chagas Disease ', ' South American Trypanosomiasis ', ' American Trypanosomiasis ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Complex ', ' success ', ' Universities ', ' Research ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Area ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Knowledge ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' United States ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Population ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Algorithms ', ' Grant ', ' Triatoma ', ' novel ', ' Pattern ', ' Training ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' skills ', ' base ', ' Mentors ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Techniques ', ' Future ', ' Tropical Medicine ', ' Work ', ' Modeling ', ' Health ', ' theories ', ' programs ', ' Patients ', ' high risk ', ' Infection ', ' Cities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Epidemic ', ' Killings ', ' Award ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Peru ', ' disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' Insect Vectors ', ' urban area ', ' Brazil ', ' vector control ', ' Trypanosoma cruzi ', ' T. cruzi ', ' American trypanosome ', ' computer science ', ' Chile ', ' international center ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Insecticides ', ' pyrethroid ', ' rural area ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' cone cell ', ' Cones (Retina) ', ' Cones (Eye) ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' Cone ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Infection Control ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,105194,PA-03,0.03586228385193052
"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          ",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,8055907,R01LM009731,"['trend ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Collection ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' theories ', ' Visual ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' United States ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Prevention ', ' success ', ' global health ', ' Data Sources ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Genotype ', ' Data ', ' pathogen ', ' International ', ' Investigation ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' DNA Typing ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' Algorithms ', ' Nature ', ' Translating ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Family ', ' Area ', ' programs ', ' Goals ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Work ', ' novel ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Rest ', ' Methods ', ' Population ', ' Address ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Complex ', ' Time ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Learning ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Patients ', ' Genomics ', ' tool ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Link ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Structure ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Pattern ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Source ', ' Modeling ', ' Knowledge ', ' genetic variant ', ' Social Network ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Research Institute ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' public health research ', ' Fingerprint ', ' relational database ', ' Guadeloupe ', ' DNA Insertion Elements ', ' insertion sequence ', ' insertion element ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' fight against ', ' patient privacy ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' New York ', ' Cities ', ' prototype ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Trees ', ' mycobacterial ', ' demographics ', ' New York City ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' family genetics ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Metric ', ' ']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2011,325956,NY-20,0.058226811483336346
"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           ",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8134899,K25CA127524,"['Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Methods ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Complex ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' response ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Sampling ', ' Play ', ' Population ', ' experience ', ' improved ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Techniques ', ' Surface ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Phase ', ' base ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Symptoms ', ' Training ', ' Research ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Diagnostic ', ' United States ', ' Staging ', ' Future ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' biomarker ', ' Laboratories ', ' Chronic ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Testing ', ' career development ', ' Incidence ', ' Measures ', ' Proteomics ', ' Patients ', ' Communities ', ' Caucasians ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Pattern ', ' Individual ', ' Modality ', ' Detection ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Outcome ', ' Data ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' novel ', ' Algorithms ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Validation ', ' Grant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Biological ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Data Sources ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Area ', ' Persons ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Goals ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Chronic Hepatitis ', ' protein metabolite ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Liver Fibrosis ', ' hepatic fibrosis ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2011,134067,TX-14,0.03238096343436907
"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC. We expect that understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will open novel approaches to direct the course of future interventions and prevention strategies by controlling the infectious agent, which are the approaches now used for managing Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer.      Public Health Relevance: Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.           Narrative Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2).

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                    The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the Hispanic population is growing significantly which is of great concern. In Hispanics, the viral infection progresses more rapidly when compared with Caucasian patients and the treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Disturbingly, current treatments seem to be less effective on Hispanics. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabolomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from patients. We will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create our first order biomarker panels. In phase two, we will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). Dr. Spratt's research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve our SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer vs non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs. ",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8308938,K25CA127524,"['Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Chronic Hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' hepatic fibrosis ', ' Liver Fibrosis ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' chronic liver disease ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' biomarker ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2012,133197,TX-14,0.031354780770927355
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.        Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. Our proposal is aimed at understanding the common strategies the bacteria use to recognize and deliver the secreted proteins to these specialized secretion systems. The results from our studies are likely to be valuable in the development of novel antimicrobials to treat common infections caused by these organisms.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8545840,K23DK097142,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Institutes ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pneumonia ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' anti-TNF-alpha therapy ', ' anti-TNF therapy ', ' Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Gene ', ' TNFSF2 ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' DIF ', ' TNF gene ', ' response ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' repository ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' patient registry ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' CD14 ', ' CD14 gene ', ' IL1RA ', ' IL1R1 ', ' IL1R ', ' IL1R1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNF-alpha ', ' Cachectin-Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Cachectin ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' tool development ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,168632,MA-08,0.01731320086260777
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised. Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model. Towards this, we have assembled a highly diverse and collaborative team including microbiologists, aerobiologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians/statisticians, veterinarians, veterinary

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8676787,K23DK097142,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Institutes ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pneumonia ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy ', ' anti-TNF-alpha therapy ', ' anti-TNF therapy ', ' Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Gene ', ' TNFSF2 ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' DIF ', ' TNF gene ', ' response ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' repository ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' patient registry ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' CD14 ', ' CD14 gene ', ' IL1RA ', ' IL1R1 ', ' IL1R ', ' IL1R1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF-alpha ', ' Cachectin-Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Cachectin ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' tool development ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,169572,MA-08,0.01731320086260777
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' breakbone fever ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' Dengue ', ' Breakbone Fever Virus ', ' Dengue Virus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever ', ' Hospitals ', ' IgM ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Latin America ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mexico ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Nicaragua ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Generations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' prognostic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinical Course of Disease ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Nicaraguan ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Detection ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Qualifying ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient Triage ', ' ']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,CO-04,-0.003959531895876406
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)?         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.            ","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8703195,U01GM110721,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antigenic Variability ', ' Antigen Variation ', ' Antigenic Variation ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Genotype ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Middle East ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' Myxovirus influenzae-A hominis ', ' Human Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Human Influenza Virus Type A ', ' Human Influenza A Virus ', ' Phenotype ', ' pneumococcus infection ', ' pneumococcal disease ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections ', ' Pneumococcal Infections ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' S. pneumoniae ', ' Pneumococcus ', ' Diplococcus pneumoniae ', ' D.pneumoniae ', ' D. pneumoniae ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' forest ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Coronavirus ', ' Coronavirus (genus) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' disease natural history ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genetic evolution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infectious Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Disease Epidemiology ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic flu ', ' pandemic influenza ', ' digital ', ' epidemiological model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel virus ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' seasonal flu ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2014,427668,,0.07246209680726644
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health.

"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8927659,U01GM110721,"['Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', '

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.                ",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,8859887,R01AI116744,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Chickens ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Head ', ' Hemagglutination ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Seasons ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' receptor binding ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Vaccine Production ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' flu outbreak ', ' influenza outbreak ', ' flu prevention ', ' Influenza prevention ', ' flu ', ' egg ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' public health relevance ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' candidate selection ', ' ']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,381704,MS-03,0.04370871672565038
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8853788,R33AI100186,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' breakbone fever ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' Dengue ', ' Breakbone Fever Virus ', ' Dengue Virus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever ', ' Hospitals ', ' IgM ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Latin America ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mexico ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Nicaragua ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Generations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' prognostic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinical Course of Disease ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Nicaraguan ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Detection ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Qualifying ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient Triage ', ' ']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2015,404827,CO-04,-0.003959531895876406
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.            ",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems

"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.            ",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,8992226,R21AI120713,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' human cytomegalovirus ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' HCMV ', ' CMV ', ' Cytomegalovirus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' immunodeficiency ', ' immune deficiency disorder ', ' hypoimmunity ', ' Immunological Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Immunodeficiency Disorder ', ' Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Infection ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Memory ', ' Microbiology ', ' Monkeys ', ' Oregon ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' SIV ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' virus protein ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Viremia ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Washington ', ' Generations ', ' AIDS Vaccines ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' rectal ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Whole Blood ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Performance ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' professor ', ' Exclusion ', ' memory T lymphocyte ', ' T memory cell ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' Swab ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Health Sciences ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Vaccine Research ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' vector ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' vaccine effectiveness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' vaccine-induced immunity ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' T cell response ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,WA-07,0.0398112236677478
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development. Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease.

"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9050106,F31LM012176,"['agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Associated Viruses ', ' Satellite Viruses ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' West Nile ', ' WNV ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' West Nile virus ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' Biological Diversity ', ' Biodiversity ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' respiratory ', ' success ', ' virus classification ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' Genbank ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Metadata ', ' novel virus ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' data acquisition ', ' usability ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' seasonal flu ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' H7N9 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2015,36613,AZ-09,0.03810036457875524
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Air ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Exotoxins ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Gases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' Toxic Megacolon ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Odors ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Smell ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' Measures ', ' Infection Control ', ' forest ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Nucleic Acid Testing ', ' Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' air sampling ', ' Provider ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Pseudomembranous Colitis ', ' Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.            ",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,8818541,R01GM108731,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffaloes ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Data Sources ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Information Sciences ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Urban Population ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' social group ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' SARS ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' H1N1 Virus ', ' H1N1 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' flu ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fundamental research ', ' human disease ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2015,621703,NY-26,0.03773061259173158
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit.

"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Antitoxins ', ' Bacterial Toxins ', ' Colitis ', ' Colon ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Continent Ileostomy ', ' Loop ileostomy ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' rRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Work ', ' scatter factor Lymphokines and Cytokines ', ' Scatter Factor ', ' Lung Fibroblast-Derived Mitogen ', ' Hepatopoietin A ', ' Hepatopoietin ', ' HGF/SF ', ' Hepatocyte Growth Factor ', ' pro-calcitonin ', ' calcitonin precursor polyprotein ', ' procalcitonin ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' Neutrophil Chemotactic Factor ', ' Neutrophil Activation Peptide ', ' Neutrophil Activation Factor ', ' Neutrophil Activating Peptide ', ' Monocyte-Derived Neutrophil-Activating Peptide ', ' Macrophage-Derived Chemotactic Factor ', ' Lymphocyte-Derived Neutrophil-Activating Peptide ', ' Leukocyte Adhesion Inhibitor ', ' Granulocyte Chemotactic Peptide-Interleukin-8 ', ' GCP-IL-8 ', ' Chemotactic Factor, Neutrophil, Monocyte-Derived ', ' Anionic Neutrophil-Activating Peptide ', ' Interleukin-8 ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Myelomonocytic Antigen L1 ', ' Migratory Inhibitory Factor-Related Protein MRP ', ' Leukocyte L1 Protein ', ' L1 Antigen ', ' Calprotectin ', ' Calgranulin ', ' Calcium-Binding Myeloid Protein P8,14 ', ' 27E10 Antigen ', ' Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex ', ' microbial host ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' data reduction ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,MI-12,-0.03312659592912301
"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.            ",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9017369,R21AI121860,"['Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteremia ', ' Bacteria ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' bone ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Wall ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Positive Bacteria ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Dimethoxyphenyl Penicillin ', ' 2,6 dimethoxyphenylpenicillin ', ' Methicillin ', ' mortality ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Staph aureus ', ' S.aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Vancomycin ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Virulence ', ' Work ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Glycopeptide Antibiotics ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Community-Acquired Infections ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Failure ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropism ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' vancomycin resistant ', ' resistant to vancomycin ', ' resistance to vancomycin ', ' Vancomycin Resistance ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk.

"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious

"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Air ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diarrhea ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Exotoxins ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Gases ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' Toxic Megacolon ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Odors ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Smell ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' Measures ', ' Infection Control ', ' forest ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Nucleic Acid Testing ', ' Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' air sampling ', ' Provider ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Pseudomembranous Colitis ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9067927,R33AI100186,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' breakbone fever ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' Dengue ', ' Breakbone Fever Virus ', ' Dengue Virus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever ', ' Hospitals ', ' IgM ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Latin America ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mexico ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Nicaragua ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Generations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' prognostic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinical Course of Disease ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Nicaraguan ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Detection ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Qualifying ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical care ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient Triage ', ' amplification detection ', ' metabolic profile ', ' Dengue Infection ', ' dengue viral infection ', ' Dengue virus infection ', ' DENV infection ', ' ']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,461274,CO-04,-0.003959531895876406
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist.

In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health.

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9214494,R01AI127472,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Budgets ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Charge ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Streptococcus faecalis ', ' Streptococcus Group D ', ' S.faecalis ', ' S. faecalis ', ' E.faecalis ', ' E. faecalis ', ' Enterococcus faecalis ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Enterobacter cloacae ', ' Enterococcus faecium ', ' Streptococcus faecium ', ' Streptococcus faceium ', ' S.faecium ', ' S.faceium ', ' S. faecium ', ' S. faceium ', ' E. faecium ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' microbial ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Klebsiella mobilus ', ' Klebsiella aerogenes ', ' K.mobilus ', ' K.aerogenes ', ' K. mobilus ', ' K. aerogenes ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes ', ' E.aerogenes ', ' E. aerogenes ', ' Aerobacter aerogenes ', ' A.aerogenes ', ' A. aerogenes ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient

"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,9267858,R21AI120713,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' Human Herpesvirus 5 ', ' HHV5 ', ' HHV 5 ', ' HCMV ', ' CMV ', ' Cytomegalovirus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' immunodeficiency ', ' immune deficiency disorder ', ' hypoimmunity ', ' Immunological Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Immunodeficiency Disorder ', ' Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Infection ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Memory ', ' Microbiology ', ' Monkeys ', ' Oregon ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' SIV ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' virus protein ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Viremia ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Washington ', ' Generations ', ' AIDS Vaccines ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' rectal ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Whole Blood ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Performance ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' professor ', ' Exclusion ', ' memory T lymphocyte ', ' T memory cell ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' Swab ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Health Sciences ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Vaccine Research ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' vector ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' vaccine effectiveness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' vaccine-induced protection ', ' vaccine-induced immunity ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Network-based ', ' efficacy testing ', ' T cell response ', ' vaccine response ', ' vaccine trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' Research Assistant ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' ']",NIAID,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2016,227250,NC-02,0.0398112236677478
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9207183,R33AI100186,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' breakbone fever ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' Dengue ', ' Breakbone Fever Virus ', ' Dengue Virus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever ', ' Hospitals ', ' IgM ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Latin America ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mexico ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Nicaragua ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Generations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' prognostic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinical Course of Disease ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Nicaraguan ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Detection ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Qualifying ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical care ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient Triage ', ' amplification detection ', ' metabolic profile ', ' Dengue Infection ', ' dengue viral infection ', ' Dengue virus infection ', ' DENV infection ', ' ']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,28614,CO-04,-0.003959531895876406

However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit.

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary

paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options

systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and

"Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction     CD4+ T cells provide numerous protective functions as part of the adaptive immune response, including cytokine-mediated and contact-mediated signals to B cells, CD8+ T cells, and innate- immune cells, as well as direct modes of attack on pathogenic agents. Nevertheless, their most critical roles in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens are especially poorly understood. A major barrier to both study and vaccine design has been the lack of epitope- specific reagents for counting and tracking CD4+ T cells. We propose to develop a novel and well-validated algorithm for CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction that will enable progress in one of the most promising, yet presently hindered fields of immunology and vaccinology. CD4+ T-cell epitope dominance has been much less predictable than CD8+ T-cell epitope dominance because the class II MHC antigen-presenting protein is less selective and because proteolytic antigen processing has a major influence on the availability of peptide ligands. In the endocytic compartments, proteases act on mostly natively folded antigens, whose 3D structure directs proteolysis to the flexibly disordered segments. Thus, potential MHC-binding sequences in the flexible segments are destroyed, and sequences in the stable antigen segments are preferentially loaded and presented to CD4+ T cells. We will incorporate this bias toward epitope dominance in the stable antigen segments into a computational tool that significantly improves upon existing sequence-based methods for epitope prediction. We will develop our stability-based method using several possible supervised learning techniques, including hidden Markov models and position-specific scoring matrix methods. For soluble antigens, our feature set will be conformational stability data including crystallographic b-factor, surface-accessibility, COREX residue stabilities, and sequence entropy. In order to validate our method, we will use it to predict novel epitopes for 5 soluble secreted antigens from Salmonella typhimurium and Burkholderia pseudomallei, organisms for which CD4+ T-cell immunity is essential. Peptides corresponding to the 80th- percentile of predicted-epitopes will be tested for responses in individual C57BL/6 mice, following two types of exposure to the intact antigens, bacterial infection and subunit vaccination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4+ T cells constitute a major arm of the immune system, recognizing foreign antigens only when small pieces (epitopes) of the antigens are presented to them by other cells. Knowing what epitopes are going to be presented is key to understanding how the immune system works and may tell us how to design vaccines. Existing methods for predicting computational epitope prediction have not considered by the machinery that breaks the antigen into epitopes. We propose to use machine learning techniques to model how antigens are processed using experimental immune response data. The primary outcome of this project is an improved method for CD4+ T cell epitope prediction that can be combined with existing tools.                ",Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction,9019992,R21AI122199,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Epitopes ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-Cells ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II ', ' MHC class II antigen ', ' MHC Class II Protein ', ' MHC Class II Molecule ', ' Immune-Response-Associated Antigens ', ' Immune Response Antigens ', ' Ia-Like Antigens ', ' Ia Antigens ', ' I-A Antigen ', ' Class II Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Class II Antigens ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class II ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudomonas pseudomallei ', ' P.pseudomallei ', ' P. pseudomallei ', ' B. pseudomallei ', ' Burkholderia pseudomallei ', ' Reagent ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' S.typhimurium ', ' S. typhimurium ', ' Salmonella typhimurium ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' antigen processing ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Epitope Mapping ', ' T-Cell Epitopes ', ' T-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' Proteolysis ', ' expression cloning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' markov model ', ' vaccinology ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' arm ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIAID,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2016,225750,LA-01,0.005152508118203644
"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,9031775,R01GM108731,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffaloes ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Information Sciences ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Urban Population ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' social group ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' SARS ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' H1N1 Virus ', ' H1N1 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' flu ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fundamental research ', ' human disease ', ' network models ', ' ']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,583077,NY-26,0.03773061259173158
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9099895,U01GM110721,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antigenic Variability ', ' Antigen Variation ', ' Antigenic Variation ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Middle East ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' mortality ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' pneumococcus infection ', ' pneumococcal disease ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections ', ' Pneumococcal Infections ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' S. pneumoniae ', ' Pneumococcus ', ' Diplococcus pneumoniae ', ' D.pneumoniae ', ' D. pneumoniae ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' forest ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Coronaviridae Infections ', ' Coronavirus ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' disease natural history ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genetic evolution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infectious Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Disease Epidemiology ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic flu ', ' pandemic influenza ', ' digital ', ' epidemiological model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel virus ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' seasonal flu ', ' surveillance data ', ' Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ', ' Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ', ' MERS-CoV ', ' ']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2016,418572,,0.07246209680726644
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. Real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a field with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact public health. The goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical modeling frameworks for making forecasts of infectious diseases in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches,9335405,R35GM119582,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Decision Making ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' analytical method ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' vector control ', ' rapid growth ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2017,372122,MA-02,0.03977536118904379
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9314691,K08AI125682,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Equipment ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' In Vitro ', ' Indiana ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Training ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' parasaetemia ', ' Parasitemia ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' Sterility ', ' sterile ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' parasite invasion ', ' in vitro activity ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical predictors ', ' malaria transmission ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2017,185224,IN-07,0.0362014529066845
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems

"Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction     CD4+ T cells provide numerous protective functions as part of the adaptive immune response, including cytokine-mediated and contact-mediated signals to B cells, CD8+ T cells, and innate- immune cells, as well as direct modes of attack on pathogenic agents. Nevertheless, their most critical roles in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens are especially poorly understood. A major barrier to both study and vaccine design has been the lack of epitope- specific reagents for counting and tracking CD4+ T cells. We propose to develop a novel and well-validated algorithm for CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction that will enable progress in one of the most promising, yet presently hindered fields of immunology and vaccinology. CD4+ T-cell epitope dominance has been much less predictable than CD8+ T-cell epitope dominance because the class II MHC antigen-presenting protein is less selective and because proteolytic antigen processing has a major influence on the availability of peptide ligands. In the endocytic compartments, proteases act on mostly natively folded antigens, whose 3D structure directs proteolysis to the flexibly disordered segments. Thus, potential MHC-binding sequences in the flexible segments are destroyed, and sequences in the stable antigen segments are preferentially loaded and presented to CD4+ T cells. We will incorporate this bias toward epitope dominance in the stable antigen segments into a computational tool that significantly improves upon existing sequence-based methods for epitope prediction. We will develop our stability-based method using several possible supervised learning techniques, including hidden Markov models and position-specific scoring matrix methods. For soluble antigens, our feature set will be conformational stability data including crystallographic b-factor, surface-accessibility, COREX residue stabilities, and sequence entropy. In order to validate our method, we will use it to predict novel epitopes for 5 soluble secreted antigens from Salmonella typhimurium and Burkholderia pseudomallei, organisms for which CD4+ T-cell immunity is essential. Peptides corresponding to the 80th- percentile of predicted-epitopes will be tested for responses in individual C57BL/6 mice, following two types of exposure to the intact antigens, bacterial infection and subunit vaccination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4+ T cells constitute a major arm of the immune system, recognizing foreign antigens only when small pieces (epitopes) of the antigens are presented to them by other cells. Knowing what epitopes are going to be presented is key to understanding how the immune system works and may tell us how to design vaccines. Existing methods for predicting computational epitope prediction have not considered by the machinery that breaks the antigen into epitopes. We propose to use machine learning techniques to model how antigens are processed using experimental immune response data. The primary outcome of this project is an improved method for CD4+ T cell epitope prediction that can be combined with existing tools.",Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction,9241328,R21AI122199,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Epitopes ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cloning ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II ', ' MHC class II antigen ', ' MHC Class II Protein ', ' MHC Class II Molecule ', ' Immune-Response-Associated Antigens ', ' Immune Response Antigens ', ' Ia-Like Antigens ', ' Ia Antigens ', ' I-A Antigen ', ' Class II Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Class II Antigens ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class II ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Burkholderia pseudomallei ', ' Pseudomonas pseudomallei ', ' P.pseudomallei ', ' P. pseudomallei ', ' P pseudomallei ', ' B. pseudomallei ', ' B pseudomallei ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Salmonella typhimurium ', ' S.typhimurium ', ' S. typhimurium ', ' S typhimurium ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' antigen processing ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' Epitope Mapping ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Proteolysis ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' Process ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' markov model ', ' vaccinology ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' ']",NIAID,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2017,188125,LA-01,0.005152508118203644
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options

(tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9220609,R01AI128215,"['Algorithms ', ' antituberculosis ', ' anti-tuberculosis ', ' Tuberculostatic Agents ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' Antitubercular Agents ', ' Cell Wall ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Tolerance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' Measures ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' fitness ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' combinatorial ', ' efflux pump ', ' network models ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' Systems Development ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptome ', ' novel drug combination ', ' novel pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new drug combination ', ' ']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2017,871572,WA-07,0.021237916263609977
"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[''],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,MD-07,0.025371230708045183
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9189635,F31LM012176,"['agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' virus genome ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' West Nile ', ' WNV ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' West Nile virus ', ' Work ', ' Zoonotic Infection ', ' Zoonotic ', ' Zoonoses ', ' Measures ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' viral integration ', ' Virus Integration ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' Infectious Disease Reportings ', ' Infectious Disease Reporting ', ' Disease Notification ', ' Biological Diversity ', ' Biodiversity ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' respiratory ', ' success ', ' virus classification ', ' virus genetics ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' Genbank ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' novel virus ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' data acquisition ', ' usability ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' seasonal flu ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype ', ' H7N9 ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' health data ', ' ']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2017,38800,AZ-09,0.03810036457875524
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9241329,R21AI121860,"['Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteremia ', ' Bacteria ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' bone ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Wall ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Positive Bacteria ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Methicillin ', ' Dimethoxyphenyl Penicillin ', ' 2,6 dimethoxyphenylpenicillin ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' Staph aureus ', ' S.aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' S aureus ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vancomycin ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Virulence ', ' Work ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Glycopeptide Antibiotics ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Community-Acquired Infections ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Failure ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Vancomycin Resistance ', ' vancomycin resistant ', ' resistant to vancomycin ', ' resistance to vancomycin ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Point of Care Device for Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics in Potentially Septic Hospital Populations Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. A dominant factor underlying this behavior is the lack of rapid methods to determine whether or not an individualized patient would actually benefit from the intended course of antibiotics. Furthermore, if a course of antibiotics are chosen to be administered, it is not clear how to optimize the de-escalation of the antibiotics. This results in a blanket antibiotics approach, where nearly every patient with even a possibility of sepsis is dosed with broad spectrum antibiotics and stays on these antibiotics for far longer than is necessary. Procalcitonin (PCT) has shown much promise in recent years as a potential discriminator between bacterial and viral infections. Various assays for PCT from company such as bioMerieux and Roche have received 510k clearance from the FDA for use by physicians in optimizing the administration of antibiotics. In addition, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria are often used as rough indications of a global inflammatory problem in patients. Of these four criteria (WBC count, respiratory rate, heart rate, and temperature), only the WBC count is not currently possible to measure outside of clinical labs. A handheld device that could combine both a WBC count and a plasma PCT measurement from a drop of blood in 10 minutes could revolutionize the administration of antibiotics in acute care settings. In particular, obtaining the first measurement of both PCT and WBC as early as possible before arrival to Emergency Departments is critical. Ideally this would be obtained in the most common “funnels” into the acute care EDs, including outpatient, ambulatory, and nursing home settings. Several studies have shown that the temporal trends of these two parameters can be very powerful for further adjustments to the administered antibiotics. For example, Roche’s Elecsys BRAHMS PCT system recommends that a PCT measurement is performed at both day 0 and day 4, and that the difference should be used to inform optimization of the antibiotics. ElectroCyt, Inc. is an early stage company that has raised $1.7M in investment and has licensed its core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The company aims to develop a hand-held electronic reader with an accompanying pipeline of cartridge designs to measure a variety of cell counts, cell surface receptor expression levels, and plasma protein expression levels. Our first cartridge will measure a total WBC count and PCT from a drop of blood. The company has signed an exciting joint development agreement (JDA) with Foxconn Interconnect Technologies (FIT) to co-develop the low cost prototype cartridge and hand- held readers (letter attached). In addition, ElectroCyt has also established two clinical partnerships with hospitals to perform clinical studies (letters attached) to build a unique combined biomarker/EMR dataset. This dataset, when combined with machine learning for predictive analytics and the patient’s latest biomarker readings, will provide real time feedback to physicians as to a patient’s overall “immune state score”. This score could be used as individualized evaluation of how well a patient is recovering or not recovering from a septic event, which can help physicians adjust course of antibiotics with real time feedback. In this project, we will adapt our core technology, which has focused on cell measurements, to enable plasma protein measurements as well. In addition, we will continue to perform clinical studies to build the unique combined biomarker + EMR dataset at three clinical sites, University of Chicago Main Hospital, Carle Foundation Hospital and Order of Saint Francis (OSF) hospital.

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Population genomics of adaptation Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",Population genomics of adaptation,9383198,R01GM117241,"['Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Anopheles ', ' Anopheles Genus ', ' Awareness ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Beds ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Insecticide Resistance ', ' insecticide resistant ', ' Insecticides ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Learning ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Plasmodium ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Production ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Anopheles gambiae ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Mosquito-borne infectious disease ', ' Mosquito-borne disease ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' fight against ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' resistance allele ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' malaria transmission ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' malaria infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,295480,NJ-06,0.0395145256528307
"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population. They are: how to represent individuals as heterogeneous, mobile, and interacting and how to model the disease dispersion process from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network. To address these issues, this project proposes to: (1) use mobile phone data to construct a three-population and three-scale social network (3p3sNet); (2) simulate the spatially and temporally dynamic dispersion of influenza through an urban population in Buffalo, NY; and (3) conduct an intensive, data-rich validation process on the simulated influenza dispersion.",A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion,9228386,R01GM108731,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffaloes ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Urban Population ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' social group ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ', ' SARS ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' H1N1 Virus ', ' H1N1 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' flu ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fundamental research ', ' human disease ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,483684,NY-26,0.03773061259173158
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9213066,R01AI127375,"['patient population ', '

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant

Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Award ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Critical Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9420097,U01CK000536,[''],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2017,649361,DC-98,0.048134650623433126
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['communicable disease control agent ', ' Antiinfective Agents ', ' AntiInfectives ', ' AntiInfective Drugs ', ' Anti-infective Preparation ', ' Anti-Infectives ', ' Anti-Infective Drugs ', ' Anti-Infective Agents ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Monilia ', ' Candida ', ' Moniliasis ', ' Candidosis ', ' Candidiasis ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Mycoses ', ' fungus infection ', ' fungal infection ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Infection Control ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' human subject ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Effector Cell ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' candidemia ', ' candidaemia ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' migration ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Patient risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' genomic signature ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,NC-04,0.06871107745101804
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9357523,R01AI127472,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Budgets ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Charge ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Enterococcus faecalis ', ' Streptococcus faecalis ', ' Streptococcus Group D ', ' S.faecalis ', ' S. faecalis ', ' S faecalis ', ' E.faecalis ', ' E. faecalis ', ' E faecalis ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' C difficile ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Enterobacter cloacae ', ' Streptococcus faecium ', ' Streptococcus faceium ', ' S.faecium ', ' S.faceium ', ' S. faecium ', ' S. faceium ', ' S faecium ', ' S faceium ', ' E. faecium ', ' E faecium ', ' Enterococcus faecium ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Period Analysis ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' microbial ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium ', ' Klebsiella mobilus ', ' Klebsiella aerogenes ', ' K.mobilus ', ' K.aerogenes ', ' K. mobilus ', ' K. aerogenes ', ' K mobilus ', ' K aerogenes ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes ', ' E.aerogenes ', ' E. aerogenes ', ' E aerogenes ', ' Aerobacter aerogenes ', ' A.aerogenes ', ' A. aerogenes ', ' A aerogenes ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9279143,U01GM110721,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,9486377,R01AI136799,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Permeability ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Walkers ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' uptake ', ' antibacterial ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' success ', ' cell envelope ', ' trait ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Drug Efflux ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Molecular ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' antibiotic export ', ' antibiotic efflux ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' experimental analysis ', ' efflux pump ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' clinical investigation ', ' multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' MDR P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR P aeruginosa ', ' multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2018,1421601,OK-04,0.05797127842495217

paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in  laboratory media that ignores the actual physiologic conditions in the host and the host immune system.  We  have discovered potent antimicrobial activities of existing antibiotics against highly “drug­resistant superbugs”  that are currently ignored but revealed in synergy with the human immune system. This program proposes a  holistic and comprehensive systems biology approach to systematically discover novel treatment opportunities  and underlying mechanisms using a novel iterative data generation, analysis, and modeling workflow.       ",Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9535858,R01AI127472,"['Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium ', ' Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Budgets ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Charge ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Enterococcus faecalis ', ' Streptococcus faecalis ', ' Streptococcus Group D ', ' S.faecalis ', ' S. faecalis ', ' S faecalis ', ' E.faecalis ', ' E. faecalis ', ' E faecalis ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C diff ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Enterobacter cloacae ', ' Enterococcus faecium ', ' Streptococcus faecium ', ' Streptococcus faceium ', ' S.faecium ', ' S.faceium ', ' S. faecium ', ' S. faceium ', ' S faecium ', ' S faceium ', ' E. faecium ', ' E faecium ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Period Analysis ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' microbial ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium ', ' Klebsiella mobilus ', ' Klebsiella aerogenes ', ' K.mobilus ', ' K.aerogenes ', ' K. mobilus ', ' K. aerogenes ', ' K mobilus ', ' K aerogenes ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes ', ' E.aerogenes ', ' E. aerogenes ', ' E aerogenes ', ' Aerobacter aerogenes ', ' A.aerogenes ', ' A. aerogenes ', ' A aerogenes ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ', ' methicillin-resistant S. aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9599007,R21AI135820,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Birds ', ' Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Information Theory ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Avian Influenza A Virus ', ' bird flu virus ', ' avian flu virus ', ' Myxovirus pestis galli ', ' Fowl Plague Virus ', ' Avian Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Avian Influenza Virus ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Generations ', ' Reassortant Viruses ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' mutant ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' virus genetics ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' enzootic ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' Polymerase ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' H1N1 Virus ', ' H1N1 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic flu ', ' pandemic influenza ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' novel virus ', ' transmission of the flu virus ', ' influenza transmission ', ' flu transmission ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' gain of function ', ' H7N9 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' flu surveillance ', ' influenza surveillance ', ' ']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,181875,MS-03,0.040497190261570594
"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated.

"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9444928,R21AI136014,"['Antigen-Presenting

"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Agar ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Printing ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Surface ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Hour ', ' Test Result ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' biocompatibility ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial ', ' Resistance to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant bacteria ', ' multi-drug resistant bacteria ', ' Resistant to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' developing resistance ', ' Resistant development ', ' Resistance development ', ' pathogen ', ' direct application ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' prototype ', ' Regimen ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' ']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,MA-07,0.061399981310030084
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not.

"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Algorithms ', ' Amplifiers ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Privatization ', ' Reagent ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' Staph aureus ', ' S.aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' S aureus ', ' Testing ', ' Vancomycin ', ' Work ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement ', ' Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' End Point Assay ', ' Endpoint Assays ', ' Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance ', ' bacterial resistance to antibiotic ', ' bacterial antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic resistant bacteria ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Affairs ', ' Invaded ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nanosensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nano sensing ', ' nanosensors ', ' Antibiotic susceptibility ', ' pathogen ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' combat ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' individual patient ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,MA-07,0.08159874176176873
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9427961,K08AI125682,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' In Vitro ', ' Indiana ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP)

"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9505567,R03HS026019,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2018,48771,CO-06,0.053481720111816025
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9455006,U19AI135972,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' anti-virals ', '

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated.

"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9436228,R21AI135641,"['Animals ', ' Anthelmintics ', ' antihelminthic ', ' Vermifuges ', ' Antihelminthic Drugs ', ' Antihelminthic Agent ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Helminths ', ' Parasitic Worms ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Parasites ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Generations ', ' Infection Control ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' base ', ' Microscopic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Probiotics ', ' pro-biotic ', ' Informatics ', ' microbial ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' parasite infection ', ' Modeling ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' microbiome ', ' metagenome ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal flora ', ' gut microflora ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut community ', ' gut commensal ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' gut microbiota ', ' Intestinal parasite ', ' inquiry-based instruction ', ' discovery learning ', ' inquiry-based learning ', ' neglected tropical diseases ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' Natural Products ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbiota ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' infected with helminth ', ' helminthic infection ', ' helminth infection ', ' gut microbial species ', ' gut microbes ', ' ']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,220500,OR-04,0.0573948060822742
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated. Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9406513,F31LM012176,"['Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' West Nile virus ', ' West Nile ', ' WNV ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' Work ', ' Zoonoses ', ' Zoonotic Infection ', ' Zoonotic ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Virus Integration ', ' viral integration ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' Infectious Disease Reportings ', ' Infectious Disease Reporting ', ' Disease Notification ', ' Biological Diversity ', ' Biodiversity ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' respiratory ', ' success ', ' virus classification ', ' virus genetics ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' Genbank ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' novel virus ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' data acquisition ', ' usability ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' seasonal flu ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' H7N9 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' health data ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' bioinformatics resource ', ' ']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,40590,AZ-09,0.03810036457875524
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9392522,R01AI128215,"['Algorithms ', ' Antitubercular Agents ', ' antituberculosis ', ' anti-tuberculosis ', ' Tuberculostatic Agents ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' Cell Wall ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Drug Tolerance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' Measures ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' fitness ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' combinatorial ', ' efflux pump ', ' network models ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' Systems Development ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' transcriptome ', ' novel pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new drug combination ', ' novel drug combination ', ' ']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2018,912707,WA-07,0.021237916263609977
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9566413,R01AI145057,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Bacteriology ', ' Cholera ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Exanthema ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Rash ', ' Exanthem ', ' Exercise ', ' Fever ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Leptospirosis ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Measles ', ' morbilli ', ' Rubeola ', ' Melioidosis ', ' Meningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Bacterial Meningitis ', ' Assimilations ', ' spreading factor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' authority ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' General Infectious Diseases / Treatment ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' flu ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' open source ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' surveillance data ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' resistant gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistance gene ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Medical emergency ', ' climatological data ', ' climatic data ', ' climate data ', ' individual patient ', ' cost outcomes ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' acute infection ', ' ']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,1527723,PA-10,0.049923876320169154

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9406205,R01AI116744,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Chickens ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Head ', ' Hemagglutination ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Seasons ', ' Serologic tests ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Ships ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Work ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Immunology procedure ', ' immunologic assay/test ', ' immunologic assay ', ' Viral ', ' receptor binding ', ' receptor bound ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' genome sequencing ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Vaccine Production ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' flu outbreak ', ' influenza outbreak ', ' flu prevention ', ' Influenza prevention ', ' egg ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' public health relevance ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' candidate selection ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' flu surveillance ', ' influenza surveillance ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,372603,MS-03,0.04370871672565038
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9495704,U01GM110721,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals

"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Award ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9530534,R21AI132978,"['Anti-Infective Agents ', ' communicable disease control agent ', ' Antiinfective Agents ', ' AntiInfectives ', ' AntiInfective Drugs ', ' Anti-infective Preparation ', ' Anti-Infectives ', ' Anti-Infective Drugs ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Candida ', ' Monilia ', ' Candidiasis ', ' Moniliasis ', ' Candidosis ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fever ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Mycoses ', ' fungus infection ', ' fungal infection ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Infection Control ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' human subject ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Effector Cell ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' candidemia ', ' candidaemia ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' migration ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' Patient risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,198750,NC-04,0.06871107745101804
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9536694,R01AI127375,"['Alleles ', '

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"A three-population three-scale social network model to assess disease dispersion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Communicable diseases, such as influenza, are transmitted from individual to individual following a network of contacts in a population. Reports on recent outbreaks, such as SARS, the Bird flu, and the H1N1 flu, have repeatedly stressed the critical role of contact networks. We propose an innovative Three-population and Three-scale Social Network (3p3sNet) model to simulating the spatial and temporal dispersion of influenza in a metropolitan population in Buffalo, NY. The 3p3sNet aims to construct a realistic contact network by representing interacting and mobile behaviors of individuals at three scales and three types of places. These involve individual (microscopic) -> local network (mesoscopic) -> population (macroscopic) as nighttime population at homes, daytime population at workplaces, and pastime population at service places. Through this network, diseases disperse from infectious individuals to their local networks then to the population-wide network in a complex dynamic fashion. Modeling the disease dispersion through this network provides invaluable insights in who might be at risk, where and when this risk might occur, and with whom these at-risk individuals might be in contact. These insights lay the foundation of developing spatially and temporally sensitive intervention strategies targeted towards the most vulnerable individuals and social groups. Furthermore, the 3p3sNet can be applied in modeling the epidemiology of any disease where human contacts play a critical role.  In implementing 3p3sNet, we propose to use mobile phone data to extract the individual interaction and travel behaviors. We embrace recent developments in economics, geostatistics, econometrics, and machine learning to construct the network. We develop an innovative co-kriging approach to expanding local households to population-wide households and a novel distance-based GEV discrete choice model to link homes to workplaces and service places. It is anticipated that the assemblage of these advanced methods will enable new capabilities and bring transformative improvements in health-related studies in metropolitan areas. We will conduct a data-rich validation process for the three constructed populations, the links between them, and the simulated disease dispersion through the population. A comprehensive range of independent datasets will be used to support the proposed validation. These involve high-resolution population, workplace, and service place data, surveys of individual interaction and travel behavior, and reports on influenza infections.  The multidisciplinary team comprises world-renown leaders and scholars in epidemiology, agent-based and social network modeling, human mobility analysis, geographical information science, and machine learning. The proposed project represents emerging frontiers in the modeling of communicable diseases and will redefine the capabilities of epidemiological models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses two issues of central importance to successfully capturing the complex, spatial and temporal dispersion process of a communicable disease through a population.

"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis.

"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9681394,R03HS026019,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2019,51181,CO-06,0.053481720111816025
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot

"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,9758579,F31AI133871,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Babesia microti ', ' Babesiosis ', ' Piroplasmosis ', ' Babesia parasite infection ', ' Behavior ', ' Bite ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' B.burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Dangerousness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Entomology ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' granulocyte ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' geographic population ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Temperature ', ' Ixodida ', ' Ticks ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Tick-Borne Infections ', ' tickborne infection ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tickborne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Black-legged Tick ', ' blacklegged tick ', ' Ixodid ticks ', ' Ixodes scapularis ', ' I. scapularis ', ' I scapularis ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Human Nature ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' model design ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' environmental change ', ' Ecological Change ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' anthropogenesis ', ' anthropogenic ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' cost effective ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' human disease ', ' vector transmission ', ' spatial temporal variation ', ' demographics ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Anaplasmosis ', ' decision tree learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' infection risk ', ' regression trees ', ' tick-borne pathogen ', ' tickborne pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,PA-03,0.041881509197690195
"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9765031,R01AI127472,"['Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium ', ' Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' bacteria infection ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Budgets ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Charge ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Streptococcus faecalis ', ' Streptococcus Group D ', ' S.faecalis ', ' S. faecalis ', ' S faecalis ', ' E.faecalis ', ' E. faecalis ', ' E faecalis ', ' Enterococcus faecalis ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C diff ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Enterobacter cloacae ', ' Streptococcus faecium ', ' Streptococcus faceium ', ' S.faecium ', ' S.faceium ', ' S. faecium ', ' S. faceium ', ' S faecium ', ' S faceium ', ' E. faecium ', ' E faecium ', ' Enterococcus faecium ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Period Analysis ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' microbial ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes bacterium ', ' Klebsiella mobilus ', ' Klebsiella aerogenes ', ' K.mobilus ', ' K.aerogenes ', ' K. mobilus ', ' K. aerogenes ', ' K mobilus ', ' K aerogenes ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes ', ' E.aerogenes ', ' E. aerogenes ', ' E aerogenes ', ' Aerobacter aerogenes ', ' A.aerogenes ', ' A. aerogenes ', ' A aerogenes ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' methicillin-resistant S. aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Award ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Critical Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Structural Genes ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP)

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications.

"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9751202,R01AI127375,"['Alleles ', '

"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9744005,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins ', ' Acute-Phase Reactants ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Serum amyloid A protein ', ' Serum Amyloid A ', ' Serum A Related Protein ', ' Amyloid-Related Serum Protein (SAA) ', ' Amyloid Serum Protein SAA ', ' Amyloid Protein SAA ', ' Amyloid Protein AA Precursor ', ' Amyloid A Protein-Related Serum Component ', ' Amyloid A Precursor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Archives ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' bacteria infection ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Proteins ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' Haptoglobins ', ' Immunoassay ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infant ', ' newborn care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' infant health care ', ' baby care ', ' Infant Care ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Conserved Sequence ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Infection ', ' instrumentation ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' newborn mortality ', ' newborn death ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Running ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Custom ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' neonatal sepsis ', ' Respiratory distress ', ' single cell analysis ', ' microbial ', ' melting ', ' novel ', ' DNA amplification ', ' Devices ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Testing ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Lysis ', ' Cytolysis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' neonate ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Sepsis ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance profile ', ' Resistant profile ', ' Neonatal ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Microbe ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' plasmid DNA ', ' high risk ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' pathogen genome ', ' pathogenome ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' pathogen genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,CA-17,0.07352526426080715
"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),9707307,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' bacteria infection ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Biology ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' digestive disorder ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DNA Viruses ', ' Family ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' rRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' virus genome ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virology ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Caudovirales ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' sequence database ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' parasite infection ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Norovirus ', ' Norwalk-like Viruses ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Enteric ', ' Enteral ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Preparation ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' metagenome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' virome ', ' viral microbiome ', ' human virome ', ' experimental analysis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' genome annotation ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' dark matter ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' bacteriome ', ' bacterial microbiome ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' contig ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2019,1872216,MO-01,0.0363085201868938
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community.

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9594144,R01AI128215,"['Antitubercular Agents ', ' antituberculosis ', ' anti-tuberculosis ', ' Tuberculostatic Agents ', ' Cell Wall ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Tolerance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' Measures ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' fitness ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' combinatorial ', ' efflux pump ', ' network models ', ' tuberculosis drugs ', ' antituberculosis drugs ', ' anti-tuberculosis drugs ', ' anti-TB drugs ', ' TB drugs ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' Systems Development ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' novel drug combination ', ' novel pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new drug combination ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' Tnseq ', ' Tn-seq ', ' ']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2019,902060,WA-07,0.021237916263609977
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites. Project Narrative: The Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Treatment (SCRIPT) systems biology center seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. We will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients to generate clinical phenomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data that describe the host response, pathogen characteristics and microbiome of the alveolar space during pneumonia. We will then integrate this comprehensive phenotypic data into an ecosystem-based model to generate predictive biomarkers of pneumonia outcome for subsequent validation in a second cohort and tested for causality in a humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.",Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center,9626377,U19AI135964,"['Acinetobacter ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid ', ' Cause of Death ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DNA Viruses ', ' Fungal DNA ', ' virus DNA ', ' viral DNA ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' macrophage ', ' Methylation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Flavimonas ', ' Chrysemonas ', ' Pseudomonas ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' shot gun ', ' Shotguns ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Virulence ', ' Generations ', ' Lymphocyte Subpopulations ', ' Lymphocyte Subset ', ' Pulmonary Macrophages ', ' Alveolar Macrophages ', ' Lymphoid Cell ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Bronchoalveolar Lavage ', ' bronchopulmonary lavage therapy ', ' Lung Lavage ', ' Bronchopulmonary Lavage ', ' Bronchioalveolar Lavage ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Sorting -

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Microbiology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' Staph aureus ', ' S.aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' S aureus ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' septic ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Allergic ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Organ failure ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' injured ', ' Sepsis ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' clinical care ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision treatment ', ' precision therapies ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,CA-13,-0.015772110607980536
"Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to interpret TOMi Scope depth-resolved images using a set of ear models with human middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, antibiotic stewardship for ear health. Significance: Ear infections affect 95% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antibiotic over-prescription and antibiotic resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of MEE through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic accuracy (50- 70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user experience. Therefore, objective image classification metrics to enable improved diagnostic accuracy is sorely needed to finally provide children afflicted by this disease with the correct treatment the first time. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope image classification of a set of ear models with human MEE will facilitate detection of the presence or absence of effusion (≥90% accuracy), as well as classification by the type of effusion samples (≥80% accuracy), regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect robust datasets of ex vivo human MEE, sufficient for machine learning image analysis. (2) Develop a neural network model based on the MEE dataset and apply the model to a representative test clinical dataset to determine classification feasibility. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antibiotic prescription but also antibiotic resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience dependence of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Development and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Approach to Interpret Optical Coherence Tomography Images of the Middle Ear to Improve Antibiotic Management,9847606,R43DC017422,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ear ', ' middle ear ', ' effusion ', ' Elements ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' middle ear infection ', ' Otitis Media ', ' Secretory Otitis Media ', ' Middle Ear Effusion ', ' Otitis Media with Effusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Safety ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Family suidae ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' ear drum ', ' Membrana Tympanica ', ' Eardrum ', ' Tympanic membrane ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Otoscopy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Serous ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Sterility ', ' sterile ', ' novel ', ' ear infection ', ' Patient observation ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' in vivo ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance development ', ' developing resistance ', ' Resistant development ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' standard of care ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' ex vivo imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' ']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R43,2019,223899,IL-13,0.01964298838671781
"Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy Broader Impacts  More than 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5, making ear infections among the most common childhood conditions. Family Physicians and Pediatricians see more than 20 million suspected ear infection cases per year in the US. Approximately 40% of these are misdiagnosed infections in healthy ears, leading to 6-9 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions annually. In fact, ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars wasted and millions of children placed at undue risk for adverse side effects. On a societal level, unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant resistant microorganisms adds $20B in excess healthcare costs annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians have identified improved ear infection diagnostics as necessary to slow the spread of resistant microorganisms. Unfortunately, despite updated clinical guidelines dating back to 1994, no significant reduction in unnecessary prescription rates has been achieved.  Even a modest improvement in ear infection diagnosis has the potential to positively affect millions of children, save hundreds of millions in direct costs, and slow the evolution of resistant bacteria. Cactus invented Optical Tympanometry (OT) technology to improve ear infection diagnosis in primary care, where most cases are seen. Cactus technology is 98% accurate in a clinical study of 30 pediatric participants, and works in clean and waxy ears. Intellectual Merit  Children affected with ear infection are most often too young to adequately describe their symptoms. Signs of ear infections are numerous, but they are also very non-specific. Clinical diagnosis is most commonly done by assessing a set of qualitative factors using an otoscope to provide a magnified view of the ear drum. Most clinicians look for middle ear redness. However, redness alone is less than 65% accurate, matching accuracy statistics observed in primary care. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend an objective quantitative assessment of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE). In fact, Key Action Statement 1C in the AAP’s most recent Acute Otitis Media (active ear infection requiring antibiotic treatment, AOM) guideline states:  Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE)  Currently, MEE is often unassessed due to technology limitations. Existing acoustic and pneumatic devices are slow, subjective and can be painful to children. As a result, clinicians commonly prescribe a course of antibiotics out of a preponderance of caution, or to placate parents. Cactus invented OT as a rapid, seamless means of assessing MEE during otoscopy. This SBIR Phase I proposal validates a miniaturized embodiment of OT (LED-OT) built into the familiar otoscope. Specific Aims Aim 1 (Month 0-2): Assembly and Repeatability & Reproducibility Study of LED-OT Otoscopes. Cactus has developed a patent pending (US62/675,056 & US161040195) LED-OT otoscope based on its innovative multiLED microchip, which houses all 13 wavelengths required for OT in a 6x6mm form factor. Cactus will assemble 6 LED-OT otoscope units for rigorous measurement repeatability and reproducibility assessment followed by clinical validation in Aims 2-3. Aim 2 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Collection IRB approved (UCI HS#2016-3039) data collection will take place under the supervision of UC Irvine Professor Elliot Botvinick via a sub-award. Clinical data collection mirrors that used in 510(k) applications for previously cleared acoustic devices and enables receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of LED-OT otoscopy. Aim 3 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Analysis Clinical data analysis will be concurrent with data collection, with two specific goals. First, train OT’s statistical component. Second, validate performance of LED-OT in pediatric participants using ROC analysis. A successful outcome of this proposal will be validated LED-OT technology and 6 otoscopes prepared for a pivotal study in Phase II to compare LED-OT and acoustic methods in an office setting. Together, Phase I and II will prepare LED-OT for analytical and clinical trials necessary for a 510(k) application, encourage adoption of our revolutionary technology, and facilitate private investment and relationships with strategic partners. Project Narrative  Cactus Medical, LLC is developing a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive ear infection indicator to improve ear infection diagnosis in pediatric care settings. Cactus’ SmartScope will provide physicians with an accurate indication of ear infection at the press of a button while they are performing their normal inspection of the ear drum through an otoscope. SmartScope technology has shown 98% accuracy in a pediatric clinical study. This device has the potential to save $1.5 billion annually and reduce the rate at which anti-bacterial resistance evolves by limiting unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and protect millions of children from unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9693661,R21AI135820,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Birds ', ' Avian ', ' Aves ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Information Theory ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' bird flu virus ', ' avian flu virus ', ' Myxovirus pestis galli ', ' Fowl Plague Virus ', ' Avian Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Avian Influenza Virus ', ' Avian Influenza A Virus ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' virus multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' Virus Replication ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Generations ', ' Reassortant Viruses ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' mutant ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' virus genetics ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' enzootic ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Polymerase ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Validation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype ', ' H1N1 Virus ', ' H1N1 ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic influenza ', ' pandemic strain of influenza ', ' pandemic flu ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' novel virus ', ' flu transmission ', ' transmission of the flu virus ', ' influenza transmission ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' gain of function ', ' Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype ', ' H7N9 ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' influenza surveillance ', ' flu surveillance ', ' ']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,5173,MS-03,0.040497190261570594
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream

"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9701928,R21AI135641,"['Animals ', ' Anthelmintics ', ' antihelminthic ', ' Vermifuges ', ' Antihelminthic Drugs ', ' Antihelminthic Agent ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Parasitic Worms ', ' Helminths ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' Methods ', ' Parasites ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Generations ', ' Infection Control ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' base ', ' Microscopic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Probiotics ', ' Informatics ', ' microbial ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' parasite infection ', ' Modeling ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' metagenome ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' gut microbiota ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal flora ', ' gut microflora ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut community ', ' gut commensal ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Intestinal parasite ', ' inquiry-based learning ', ' inquiry-based instruction ', ' discovery learning ', ' neglected tropical diseases ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' Natural Products ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' microbiota ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microflora ', ' microbial flora ', ' microbial consortia ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' helminth infection ', ' infected with helminth ', ' helminthic infection ', ' gut microbes ', ' gut microbial species ', ' enteric infection ', ' intestine infection ', ' intestinal infection ', ' infected with enteropathogen ', ' enteropathogen\xa0infection ', ' enteropathogenic infection ', ' enteric pathogen infection ', ' enteral infection ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,183750,OR-04,0.0573948060822742
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9821551,K01AI141616,"['Affect ', ' Antimalarials ', ' anti-malarial drugs ', ' anti-malarial agents ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biomass ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' California ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Lymphatic Filariasis ', ' Bancroftian Elephantiasis ', ' Filarial Elephantiases ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insecticides ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Culicidae ', ' Southwest Africa ', ' South West Africa ', ' Namibia ', ' volvulosis ', ' onchocercosis ', ' Onchocerciasis ', ' Parasites ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Polio ', ' Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Poliomyelitis ', ' Public Health ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' variola major ', ' small pox ', ' Variola ', ' Smallpox ', ' Swaziland ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Zambia ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Modification ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistance ', ' resistant to antimalarial drug ', ' resistant to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistance to antimalarial drug ', ' resistance to anti-malarial drug ', ' antimalarial resistance ', ' anti-malarial resistance ', ' Antimalarial drug resistant ', ' Antimalarial drug resistance ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistant ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' chemotherapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' malaria transmission ', ' low income country ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,146551,CA-13,0.0067330187006023395
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need.

"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9776462,R01AI145057,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Bacteriology ', ' Cholera ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Rash ', ' Exanthem ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exercise ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Leptospirosis ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' morbilli ', ' Rubeola ', ' Measles ', ' Melioidosis ', ' Meningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Bacterial Meningitis ', ' Assimilations ', ' spreading factor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' authority ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' flu ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' open source ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' surveillance data ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' resistance gene ', ' resistant gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Medical emergency ', ' climate data ', ' climatological data ', ' climatic data ', ' individual patient ', ' cost outcomes ', ' personalized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' acute infection ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neonatal infection ', ' newborn infection ', ' infected newborn ', ' infected neonate ', ' infected infant ', ' infant infection ', ' ']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,1606082,PA-10,0.049923876320169154
"Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid breath-based respiratory pathogen identification and treatment monitoring Project Summary Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are caused by a number of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens and pathogen identification is needed to administer the correct treatment. However, due to the lagtime in standard biochemical assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, clinicians have come to depend on broad-spectrum, empirical treatment which contributes to both drug resistance and patient death. The goal of this project is to develop a breath test for rapid pathogen identification and treatment monitoring in ARI to facilitate more immediate, targeted treatment in the clinic. The current proposal is focused on bacterial pathogen identification with future goals to expand to viral and fungal pathogens. Substrate cleavage assays are currently used to query bacterial protease activity and can be used to rapidly and accurately classify bacteria down to the species level. Leveraging the protease-responsive nanosensor platform in the Bhatia lab, the goal of this proposal is to develop inhalable multiplexed nanosensors that release volatile reporters into the breath in response to infection- associated proteases in the lung. From there, we can generate breath “fingerprints” for pathogens common in ARIs such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae). Furthermore, changes in proteolytic activity after the start of antimicrobial treatment can be used to generate a “good response” and “poor response” breath signature for more timely evaluation of drug efficacy. To this end, the specific aims of this project are the following: (1) establish a volatile- barcoding system for peptide substrates (2) build and validate an inhalable multiplexed system of protease nanosensors for pathogen identification and (3) investigate use of multiplexed protease nanosensors for monitoring response to antibiotic treatment. Aim 1 will be completed by identifying volatile reporter candidates that can be attached to peptide substrates without deleterious effects on cleavage kinetics, protease specificity, and breath signal. Once identified, volatile reporters will be isotope-labeled to create a panel of reporters with similar volatility differing only by mass. Peptides with orthogonal susceptibility to host and pathogen proteases will then be identified in Aim 2 by screening a peptide library against bacterial culture supernatants and bronchioalveolar lavage from infected mice. Peptides will then be barcoded using the VOC mass labels designed in Aim 1 and then formulated into inhalable nanosensors by attachment to a nanoparticle core. The resulting nanosensor panel will be delivered via intratracheal injection into mice infected with one of the six VAP pathogens. Machine learning will be used to generate a statistical classifier to identify pathogens based on reporter levels in breath and will be used to further identify reporter signatures for good and poor response to antibiotic treatment. Successful completion of these aims would result in a diagnostic platform that can potentially be expanded for rapid identification of an exhaustive list of respiratory pathogens, including viral and fungal pathogens. Rapid identification of the cause of respiratory infection is necessary to prescribe the correct drugs for treatment. In the following work, we propose to develop tiny, inhalable bacteria sensors for a breathalyzer test that would enable rapid identification of infectious bacteria in the lung. This would allow the correct drugs to be prescribed and prevent antibiotic overuse which contributes to the growing problem of drug resistance.",Engineering a diagnostic platform for rapid

"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection,9805550,R03AI147128,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibodies ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Cholera ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethiopia ', ' Ocular Infections ', ' Eye Infections ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hand washing ', ' Handwashing ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hygiene ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Sanitation ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Zitromax ', ' Zithromax ', ' Ultreon ', ' Azythromycin ', ' Azitrocin ', ' Azadose ', ' Azithromycin ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Serological ', ' Serologic ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' remote sensing ', ' participatory sensing ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' novel ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,2019,1299,CA-13,-0.029078228734275787
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Bacteriuria ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medical Records ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Microbiology ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Records ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Technology ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' Urological Disorders ', ' Urological Diseases ', ' Urologic Disorder ', ' Urinary Tract Diseases ', ' Urologic Diseases ', ' Urology ', ' Woman ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' urologic ', ' urological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Genetic ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Informatics ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' repository ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Institution ', ' urogenital infection ', ' infectious disease of genitourinary system ', ' Genitourinary infection ', ' GU Infection ', ' Genitourinary System Infection ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Sum ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Molecular ', ' urinary ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' microbiome ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' Uropathogen ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' microbial genome ', ' microbes genome ', ' Microbe ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' data space ', ' demographics ', ' combat ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' operation ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' health data ', ' clinical sequencing ', ' individual patient ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' symptomatology ', ' translational impact ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' Infrastructure ', ' pathogenic microbe ', ' microbial pathogen ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,TN-05,0.0755035010925039
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,9644008,R01AI136799,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Permeability ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Walkers ', ' Measures ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' uptake ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' antibacterial ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' success ', ' cell envelope ', ' trait ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Drug Efflux ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Molecular ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antibiotic efflux ', ' antibiotic export ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' experimental analysis ', ' efflux pump ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' clinical investigation ', ' multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' MDR P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR P aeruginosa ', ' human pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,1056326,OK-04,0.05797127842495217
"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9753261,R01GM117241,"['Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Anopheles Genus ', ' Anopheles ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Beds ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' insecticide resistant ', ' Insecticide Resistance ', ' Insecticides ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Culicidae ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Plasmodium ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Anopheles gambiae ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Mosquito-borne infectious disease ', ' Mosquito-borne disease ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' fight against ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' resistance allele ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' malaria transmission ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' malaria infection ', ' malarial infection ', ' malaria-infected ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' malaria mosquito ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,295000,OR-04,0.0395145256528307
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Agar ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' bacteria infection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Printing ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Surface ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Hour ', ' Test Result ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' biocompatibility ', ' Performance ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant bacteria ', ' multi-drug resistant bacteria ', ' Resistant to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Resistance development ', ' developing resistance ', ' Resistant development ', ' pathogen ', ' direct application ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' prototype ', ' Regimen ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' automated image analysis ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,MA-07,0.061399981310030084
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Filtration ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Moldova ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' National Health Programs ', ' Organizational Goals ', ' Organizational Objectives ', ' Patients ', ' Peptide Fragments ', ' Peptides ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' falls ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' treatment planning ', ' enzyme linked immunospot assay ', ' ELISPOT ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Sensitivity ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' nanodisk ', ' nano disk ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' high risk ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' T cell response ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' biomarker performance ', ' biomarker utility ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' random forest ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,CA-52,0.05648323579333478
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9626867,K08AI125682,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Equipment ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' In Vitro ', ' Indiana ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Parasites ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' Training ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Parasitemia ', ' parasaetemia ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' Sterility ', ' sterile ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' parasite invasion ', ' in vitro activity ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical predictors ', ' malaria transmission ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2019,185224,IN-07,0.0362014529066845
"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus. Results from these studies could prompt future clinical trials to test these regimens in humans for efficacy.",A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium

"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9610628,R01AI116744,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Chickens ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Head ', ' Hemagglutination ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' flu vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Seasons ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Ships ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Serological ', ' Serologic ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Immunology procedure ', ' immunologic assay/test ', ' immunologic assay ', ' Viral ', ' receptor binding ', ' receptor bound ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenza A ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Vaccine Production ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' influenza outbreak ', ' flu outbreak ', ' Influenza prevention ', ' flu prevention ', ' egg ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' public health relevance ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' candidate selection ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', ' influenza surveillance ', ' flu surveillance ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' ']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,224899,MS-03,0.04370871672565038
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",9938200,R01HS027375,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,497273,IA-02,0.032798877861012
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,9760507,F32AI145177,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antibody Avidity ', ' Antibody Specificity ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chicago ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunological Techniques ', ' Immunological Technics ', ' Immunologic Technics ', ' Immunologic Techniques ', ' Infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Medicine ', ' exo alpha sialidase ', ' Sialidase ', ' Oligosaccharide Sialidase ', ' N-Acylneuraminate Glycohydrolases ', ' Acylneuraminyl hydrolase ', ' Neuraminidase ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Seasons ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Pattern ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Molecular ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' imprint ', ' combat ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' seasonal flu ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2019,65304,IL-01,-0.004490868991920656
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9627935,U19AI135972,"['Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' anti-virals ', ' anti-viral drugs ', '

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). !

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy.

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium ', ' Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ampicillin ', ' Aminobenzylpenicillin ', ' Aminobenzyl Penicillin ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacterial disease ', ' bacteria infection ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Cefatriaxone ', ' Ceftriaxone ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Ciprofloxacin ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' U-Gencin ', ' Genoptic S.O.P.

The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and

"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary:  Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has created a major public health crisis around the world. The novel coronavirus was observed to have a long incubation period and extremely infectious during this period. No proven effective treatment or vaccine is available. Massive public interventions have been implemented in many countries and states in the United States (US) at different phases of the outbreak with varying combinations of social dis- tancing, mobility restriction and population behavioral change. Decisions on how to implement these interventions (e.g., when to impose and relax mitigation measures) rely on important statistics of COVID epidemiology (e.g., effective reproduction number) that characterize and predict the course of COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is a lack of robust and parsimonious model of COVID epidemic that can accurately reﬂect the heterogeneity between susceptible populations and regions (e.g., demographics, healthcare capacity, social and economic determinants). There is no rigorous study to guide precision public health interventions that are tailored to a population or region depending on their characteristics. Furthermore, due to the non-randomized nature of public health interventions, it is critical to account for biases and confounding when comparing mitigation measures of COVID-19 across re- gions. To address these challenges, this project develops robust and generalizable analytic methods to evaluate public health interventions and assess individual patient risks of COVID-19 infection and complications. In Aim 1, we will develop dynamic and robust statistical models to predict the disease epidemic. The models will estimate the date of the ﬁrst unknown infection case, instantaneous effective reproduction number, and account for the incu- bation period of COVID-19 virus. Furthermore, heterogeneity in population's demographics, social and economic indicators, healthcare capacity and geographic locations will be incorporated to reﬂect their impacts on COVID epidemic. Under a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we will provide valid inference for comparing public health interventions implemented at different regions while accounting for confounding bias. Multiple sources of data from different states in the US will be analyzed to empirically test which states' response strategies are more effective and in which subpopulation. In Aim 2, we will focus on developing precise risk assessment tool of individ- ual COVID-19 patients using electronic health records (EHRs) collected at New York Presbyterian hospital in New York City, an epicenter of COVID-19. We will engineer features of patient's pre-conditions associated with severe COVID complications, recovery, or death. More importantly, we will engineer features that represent proxies of virus exposures from patients' geographic information. We will use machine learning techniques to create quantitative summaries of patient prognosis (e.g., transitioning to serious clinical stages, discharge, death). We will use inter- nal cross-validation and external calibration to validate developed algorithms. The project will generate evidence to guide precision public health intervention, optimal patient care, and efﬁcient healthcare resource allocation in anticipation of a second wave of COVID epidemic and in preparation of other infectious disease outbreaks. Project Narrative:  This project aims to develop robust and generalizable analytics to evaluate public health interventions in response to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess individual patient risks using multiple sources of data (e.g., ofﬁcial reports of COVID cases, electronic health records). The project will provide quantita- tive evidence to guide precision public health interventions at the right time for the right subpopulation to effectively contain and mitigate the outbreak. It will also provide quantitative risk assessments of COVID-19 patients to facili- tate best clinical management and optimal allocation of heathcare resources.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods

"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10080771,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Testing Alternatives ', ' Animal Alternatives ', ' alternatives to animals in

"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps. These maps will provide detailed mechanisms underpinning multi-faceted interactions occurring between host and pathogen and will delineate molecular subtypes that can be utilized for novel and personalized treatment options.",Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics,10028454,R35GM138283,"['Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' EBV ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' HHV4 ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Virus Integration ', ' viral integration ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting Initiative ', ' Molecular Profiling Initiative ', ' Molecular Classification of Tumors ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' tool development ', ' tumor ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' genome analysis ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' Immune Evasion ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,381824,IN-04,0.04192195597180255
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host

"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10133883,K01AI141616,"['interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Modification ', ' scale up ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' malaria transmission ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' anti-malarial agents ', ' anti-malarial drugs ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Namibia ', ' South West Africa ', ' Southwest Africa ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Swaziland ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Training ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,48885,CA-13,0.0067330187006023395
"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection,9974479,R03AI147128,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibodies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Cholera ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethiopia ', ' Eye Infections ', ' Ocular Infections ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Handwashing ', ' hand washing ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hygiene ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Sanitation ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Azithromycin ', ' Azadose ', ' Azitrocin ', ' Azythromycin ', ' Ultreon ', ' Zithromax ', ' Zitromax ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' novel ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Data Science ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' infection risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,87707,CA-12,-0.029078228734275787
"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit.

"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass

"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10006784,R01AI145057,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Bacteriology ', ' Cholera ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Exercise ', ' Fever ', ' Pyrexia ', ' febrile ', ' febris ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Leptospirosis ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Melioidosis ', ' Meningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Bacterial Meningitis ', ' Assimilations ', ' spreading factor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' authority ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' flu ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' open source ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' surveillance data ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistant gene ', ' resistance gene ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Medical emergency ', ' climatic data ', ' climatological data ', ' climate data ', ' individual patient ', ' cost outcomes ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' acute infection ', ' Infrastructure ', ' infant infection ', ' infected infant ', ' infected neonate ', ' infected newborn ', ' newborn infection ', ' neonatal infection ', ' data fusion ', ' ']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,1627982,PA-10,0.049923876320169154
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation

"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform. Project Narrative We will compile existing TB gene expression data and develop a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease.

"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream

"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,9865174,R01AI148336,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Coccidioides ', ' Coccidioides immitis ', ' C immitis ', ' C. immitis ', ' Coccidioidomycosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Droughts ', ' Dust ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Meningitis ', ' Meteorology ', ' Methods ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Soil ', ' Reproduction spores ', ' Spores ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' environmental intervention ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' C posadasii ', ' C. posadasii ', ' Coccidioides posadasii ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' Lung infections ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' infection risk ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' Climatology ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,774446,CA-13,0.0022724976503518805
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,10088499,R00GM118907,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Peritoneal Fluid ', ' Ascitic Fluid ', ' Peritoneal Effusion ', ' Award ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biology ', ' Carbon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Culture Media ', ' growth media ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mission ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nitrogen ', ' Peritoneal lavage ', ' Peritoneal Irrigation ', ' Phosphorus ', ' P element ', ' Phosphorous ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Sulfur ', ' S element ', ' Testing ', ' Virulence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Peritoneal ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' resistance to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistant to disease ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' bactericidal ', ' bactericide ', ' commensal flora ', ' commensal microbiota ', ' commensal microflora ', ' commensal microbes ', ' Outcome ', ' Antibiotic susceptibility ', ' desensitization ', ' pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' counterscreen ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' bacteria metabolism ', ' bacterial metabolism ', ' Formulation ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' ']",NIGMS,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,R00,2020,249000,NJ-10,0.05153571045235641
"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment

"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9861218,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins ', ' Acute-Phase Reactants ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Serum amyloid A protein ', ' Amyloid A Precursor ', ' Amyloid A Protein-Related Serum Component ', ' Amyloid Protein AA Precursor ', ' Amyloid Protein SAA ', ' Amyloid Serum Protein SAA ', ' Amyloid-Related Serum Protein (SAA) ', ' Serum A Related Protein ', ' Serum Amyloid A ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Archives ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Proteins ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Haptoglobins ', ' Immunoassay ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Care ', ' baby care ', ' infant health care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' newborn care ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,10008955,F32AI145177,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antibody Avidity ', ' Antibody Specificity ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chicago ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunologic Techniques ', ' Immunologic Technics ', ' Immunological Technics ', ' Immunological Techniques ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Medicine ', ' Neuraminidase ', ' Acylneuraminyl hydrolase ', ' N-Acylneuraminate Glycohydrolases ', ' Oligosaccharide Sialidase ', ' Sialidase ', ' exo alpha sialidase ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seasons ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' Molecular ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' immunogenicity ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' imprint ', ' combat ', ' seasonal flu ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive measure ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' infection risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2020,65310,IL-01,-0.004490868991920656
"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia. Additionally, this research will provide the platform for the career development of a young scientist focused on bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning methods to tackle the dire consequences of AMR.",Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia,10055522,K01AI148593,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Carbon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Central America ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Endocarditis ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oxacillin ', ' Oxazocilline ', ' Patients ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Plasmids ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' South America ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' S aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' Staph aureus ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United Nations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vancomycin ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Virulence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Microbial Biofilms ', ' biofilm ', ' Bacterial Genome ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Soft Tissue Infections ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' β-Lactams ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' infection resistance ', ' Resistance to infection ', ' cohort ', ' insertion element ', ' insertion sequence ', ' DNA Insertion Elements ', ' novel ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Bypass ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Lateral Gene Transfer ', ' Horizontal Gene Transfer ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Order ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Mobile Genetic Elements ', ' MRSA ', ' Methicillin Resistant S Aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB).

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Infection and Illness The new coronavirus outbreak that begin in December 2019 has created a global public health emergency. This has led to an intense search to identify factors that contribute to the susceptibility and severity of illness. We recently developed an array to identify antibody-binding epitopes for rhinoviruses. Data from these arrays can be combined with information about viral protein structure to identify highly immunogenic regions for respiratory viruses. We propose to expand this array to include linear epitopes that represent the entire proteome of SARS- CoV-2 and all other common coronaviruses that infect humans (OC43, NL63, etc.). The study population will include children from the COAST, WISC and URECA birth cohort studies who are also participating in the HEROS SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study. As part of routine cohort activities, these children undergo serial sampling of blood and nasal secretions that we can analyze using the array to determine individual patterns of antiviral antibody epitope recognition. We hypothesize that the pattern and quantity of antibody specific for epitopes of common coronaviruses contributes to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. We propose three specific aims that will utilize sera obtained from children before and after HEROS-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, in specimens obtained pre-infection we will use the array to identify patterns of antibody epitope recognition to common childhood coronaviruses, assess cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and determine whether cross-reactivity is associated with protection against infection or illness. In the second aim, we will determine whether the diversity of antibody responses to common respiratory viruses is associated with a reduced risk of infection or illness. Finally, in the third aim we will describe antibody binding patterns before and after known COVID-19 cases to identify candidate regions that are immunogenic and neutralizing. To accomplish this aim, we will perform micro-neutralization assays (available in the BSL3 laboratory of Dr. Kristen Bernard, UW Madison) on convalescent sera or nasal secretions from children who developed symptomatic infection. This information will be analyzed together with pre- and post-infection array data using machine learning approaches to identify neutralizing epitopes. Identifying patterns of serologic responses that are cross- protective could help to identify susceptible individuals in the population and direct the design of vaccines to current and future viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE (from parent grant) The morbidity and cost to society from childhood viral respiratory illnesses (VRI) is staggering, and allergic respiratory disease is rampant. In the search for prevention for these common and high-burden diseases, perhaps the solutions are on the farm. Our main hypothesis is that microbes in farming environments promote immune development in early life, and thereby reduce the severity of VRI and protect against allergies. We will test this hypothesis by expanding studies in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC), a birth cohort in dairy farm country consisting of children and their families who were enrolled before birth and then monitored for farm exposures, development of the immune system, respiratory illnesses and allergies. We hope to identify farm-related exposures, including microbes, that promote healthy immune development, and ultimately, healthy children. Completion of these studies will lead to development of new strategies for raising children who get fewer respiratory illnesses and avoid developing respiratory allergies.",Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity,10170660,U19AI104317,"['Antibodies ', ' Viral Antibodies ', ' anti-viral antibody ', ' antiviral antibody ', ' Antibody Diversity ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Rhinovirus ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Viral Structural Proteins ', ' Virus ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Coronaviridae ', ' corona virus ', ' Coronavirus ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' B-Cell Epitopes ', ' B-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Farm ', ' farm environment ', ' Farming environment ', ' respiratory virus ', ' cohort ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Allergic ', ' Proteome ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' immunogenic ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Common Epitope ', ' Population ', ' Microbe ', ' B cell repertoire ', ' parent grant ', ' public health emergency ', ' surveillance study ', ' Antibody Response ', ' study population ', ' infection risk ', ' CoV emergence ', ' coronavirus emergence ', ' emergent CoV ', ' emergent coronavirus ', ' emerging CoV ', ' emerging coronavirus ', ' nCoV ', ' new CoV ', ' new coronavirus ', ' novel CoV ', ' novel coronavirus ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U19,2020,406048,WI-02,-0.09252355076667554
"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic

"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot

"MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library PROJECT SUMMARY Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram- negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve the diagnostic as discussed below.  At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids, including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.  In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection (LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram- positive organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Failure to identify bacterial and fungal infections rapidly places an enormous financial burden on the U.S. health system totaling billions annually with complications from minor events extending hospital stays to death from sepsis. We have developed a lipid-based MS method for bacterial and fungal identification that can be carried out in under an hour direct from specimen. Here, we will further develop this method for use in the study of complex biological fluids, including stool, urine, and blood bottles without culture. Specifically, we will improve the limit of detection in order to distinguish microbial load at or below 103 CFU/ml ! !",MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library,9969799,R01AI147314,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Proteins ', ' Bacterial Gene Products ', ' Bacterial Gene Proteins ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiolipins ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Colistin ', ' Colimycin ', ' Colisticin ', ' Polymyxin E ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' fungus ', ' Glycolipids ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipid A ', ' Lipids ', ' Membrane Lipids ', ' Cell Membrane Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mycoses ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' fungal infection ', ' fungus infection ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Sphingolipids ', ' Sterols ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' lipoteichoic acid ', ' lipo-teichoic acid ', ' Intensive Care ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Phosphoglycerides ', ' Glycerophospholipids ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' Rivers ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' chemical fingerprinting ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' ward ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' biodefense ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health system ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight MS ', ' Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry ', ' MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' wound ', ' pathogen ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' Microbe ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' chemotherapy ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' combat ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' stool specimen ', ' stool sample ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' feature extraction ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2020,463500,MD-07,0.05052192541525519
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster.

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9924443,U19AI142790,"['Alphavirus ', ' Alpha Virus ', ' Group A Arboviruses ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' chikungunya ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ebola virus ', ' EBOV ', ' ebolavirus ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lassa virus ', ' Lassa fever virus ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Reagent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Arenaviridae ', ' Arenavirus group ', ' Arenavirus ', ' Filoviridae ', ' Filovirus ', ' insight ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Primate Diseases ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' mAb therapy ', ' Monoclonal Antibody Therapy ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' structural biology ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' biodefense ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Hu-mABs ', ' humAbs ', ' human mAbs ', ' human monoclonals ', ' human monoclonal antibodies ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' MAb Therapeutics ', ' monoclonal antibody drugs ', ' therapeutic mAbs ', ' Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' clinical development ', ' Arthritogenic ', ' mosquitoborne ', ' mosquito-borne ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' Ebola ', ' ']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2020,7143424,CA-52,-0.06508894285895307
"Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record (EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals. Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four UCHealth hospitals.  Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection using false discovery rate correction. Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models. Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models  implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require  additional data entry by the health care providers. Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development and implementation planning. Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of ASPIN.  This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious complications of surgery (surgical site infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis) are common, occurring in about 8% of major surgical procedures, and are costly. Currently used surveillance techniques require extensive human participation, resulting in delays of at least six months before the data are available to care providers, and the data represent only a small sample of all operations. We propose to develop a machine learning-based, near real-time recurring audit and feedback system for identification of postoperative infections that will inform providers about infectious outcomes of their patients.",Automated Surveillance of Postoperative Infections (ASPIN),10117905,R01HS027417,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,392599,CO-06,0.05537708234768318
"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10056490,R21AI151344,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibodies ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Vivax Malaria ', ' Plasmodium vivax Malaria ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Parasites ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphoproteins ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Plasmodium ', ' Plasmodium vivax ', ' P vivax ', ' P. vivax ', ' Plasmodium yoelii ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Collaborations ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Host Defense ', ' Sporozoites ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' liver infection ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' small molecule ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' digital ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' shRNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' malaria infection ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' side effect ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,281780,WA-07,0.03659822247005526
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Microbiology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Staphylococcus aureus ', ' S aureus ', ' S. aureus ', ' Staph aureus ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' septic ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Allergic ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Organ failure ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' clinical care ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' sepsis patients ', ' septic patients ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,CA-13,-0.015772110607980536
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission.

"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Drainage procedure ', ' Drainage ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Hydrocephalus ', ' Hydrocephaly ', ' hydrocephalic ', ' Infection ', ' Intracranial Pressure ', ' Subarachnoid Pressure ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Hospital Charges ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' intraventricular hemorrhage ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Shunt ', ' shunts ', ' Shunt Device ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' long short term memory ', ' infection risk ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,NY-13,0.030133236351447046
"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10049219,R01AI148470,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacteria ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Fermentation ', ' Frustration ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photosynthesis ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae ', ' D pneumoniae ', ' D. pneumoniae ', ' Diplococcus pneumoniae ', ' Pneumococcus ', ' S pneumoniae ', ' S. pneumoniae ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Yeasts ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Earth ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Genomics ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' driving force ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' process optimization ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' network architecture ', ' genomic tools ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Drop-seq ', ' droplet sequencing ', ' genetic architecture ', ' anti-microbial resistance emergence ', ' antimicrobial resistance emergence ', ' emerging anti-microbial resistance ', ' emerging antimicrobial resistance ', ' antibiotic resistance emergence ', ' emerging antibiotic resistance ', ' Tn-seq ', ' Tnseq ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2020,391250,MA-04,0.025513112553619106
"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10019521,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' Phages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Viruses ', ' Family ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Caudovirales ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' parasite infection ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Norwalk-like Viruses ', ' Norovirus ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Enteric ', ' Enteral ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Preparation ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' metagenome ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Population ', ' viral microbiome ', ' virome ', ' human virome ', ' experimental analysis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' genome annotation ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' dark matter ', ' phenomenology ', ' phenomenological models ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' bacterial microbiome ', ' bacteriome ', ' stool specimen ', ' stool sample ', ' contig ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2020,1832307,MO-01,0.0363085201868938
"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications.

"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines.

"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9948579,K01AI141616,"['Affect ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' anti-malarial agents ', ' anti-malarial drugs ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biomass ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Filarial Elephantiases ', ' Bancroftian Elephantiasis ', ' Lymphatic Filariasis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insecticides ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Namibia ', ' South West Africa ', ' Southwest Africa ', ' Onchocerciasis ', ' onchocercosis ', ' volvulosis ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Poliomyelitis ', ' Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Polio ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smallpox ', ' Variola ', ' small pox ', ' variola major ', ' Swaziland ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Modification ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistant ', ' Antimalarial drug resistance ', ' Antimalarial drug resistant ', ' anti-malarial resistance ', ' antimalarial resistance ', ' resistance to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistance to antimalarial drug ', ' resistant to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistant to antimalarial drug ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistance ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' chemotherapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' malaria transmission ', ' low income country ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,146578,CA-13,0.0067330187006023395
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in  laboratory media that ignores the actual physiologic conditions in the host and the host immune system.  We  have discovered potent antimicrobial activities of existing antibiotics against highly “drug­resistant superbugs”  that are currently ignored but revealed in synergy with the human immune system. This program proposes a  holistic and comprehensive systems biology approach to systematically discover novel treatment opportunities  and underlying mechanisms using a novel iterative data generation, analysis, and modeling workflow.       ",Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens

"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10124644,K08HS027472,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2020,144640,IA-02,0.06019029717179875
"A multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy in Tuberculosis ABSTRACT The rapid spread of multi-drug resistance has created a great need for new combination therapies to treat a variety of conditions, including infectious diseases and cancer. In one pressing example, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB) affects about 500,000 people each year and novel drug regimens are sorely needed. However, identifying new regimens has been daunting in part due to the inability to prioritize among a very large number of possible drug combinations. To address this need, we have generated an experimentally grounded, machine learning algorithm, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts the synergy or antagonism of TB drug combinations with high accuracy. Here we propose to adapt INDIGO-MTB into a multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy and drive preclinical regimen development for TB. We will build in and validate the ability to predict drug interactions under stressful environmental conditions that mimic TB infection, and extract molecular mechanisms of drug interactions. We will then combine synergy and efficacy measurements to create new regimen rankings, which we will validate both in vitro and in a mouse model of TB infection. Altogether, our work will establish a tool for rapid assessment of TB drug combinations and a framework for applying this approach to other conditions where new multidrug therapies are needed. NARRATIVE Tuberculosis is a massive public health problem, and new drug regimens are sorely needed.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10132152,U19AI135972,"['Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', '

"T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium Project Summary  Tick-borne diseases are on the increase, and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. To survive within eukaryotic cells, the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum blocks phago-lysosome maturation, inhibits apoptosis, modulates host gene expression, redirects trans-Golgi trafficking, and repurposes autophagic machinery to build a replication vacuole. A. phagocytophilum must accomplish this, all while evading the unique innate immune defenses of mammalian and arthropod host cells. All pathogens in the order Rickettsiales utilize a specialized Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector molecules into the host cell cytosol to mediate host pathogen interactions. However, identification of the secreted effectors has been limited by the obligate nature of these pathogens. Even less is known about how effectors contribute to rickettsial growth in tick cells, as the tick vector remains an understudied niche of these pathogens. To overcome this, our group has developed a T4SS effector prediction program Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effectors (OPT4e). When applied to A. phagocytophilum, OPT4e identified 48 putative T4SS effectors. Transcriptomics finds that 15 of these predicted effector genes are specifically expressed during growth within either tick or mammalian cells. We have demonstrated that one of these tick- specific effector candidates, Aph1383, is translocated in a T4 specific manner by the Legionella pneumophila T4SS. Aph1383 also belongs to a paralogous family of six proteins encoded by the gene cluster aph1380-1386. This entire cluster is expressed 2.5-fold more highly during A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells than during mammalian cell infections. We hypothesize that this family of Aph1383 paralogs are all T4SS effectors which target host cell processes specifically important for A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. In this study, we will first use transposon insertion mutants in the aph1380-1386 gene cluster to test the fitness contribution of these genes during A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. Next, we will evaluate the T4SS translocation of all Aph1383 paralogs and identify the amino acid sequences necessary for secretion. Finally, we will identify the subcellular localization and molecular targets of Aph1383 within tick cells. Characterizing these molecular interactions of A. phagocytophilum within the tick cell will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the pathogen. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases account for >17% of the global burden of all infectious diseases. The ability of the tick-borne rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum to manipulate the cell biology of both mammalian and tick cells is achieved through delivery of effector molecules by a specialized secretion system. This project investigates how a family of tick specific effectors enables A. phagocytophilum to survive and replicate within tick cells.",T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium,10041492,R21AI154023,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Anaplasma ', ' Arthropod Vectors ', ' Arthropods ', ' Arthropoda ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cytosol ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Golgi Apparatus ', ' Golgi ', ' Golgi Complex ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Infection ', ' Legionella pneumophila ', ' L pneumophila ', ' L. pneumophila ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Parasites ', ' Phagolysosome ', ' Proteins ', ' Rickettsia ', ' Rickettsiales ', ' Salivary Glands ', ' Salivary Glands Head and Neck ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Ticks ', ' Ixodida ', ' Transfection ', ' United States ', ' Vacuole ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Mediating ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' Biochemical ', ' Midgut ', ' Tropism ', ' A phagocytophila ', ' A phagocytophilum ', ' A. phagocytophila ', ' A. phagocytophilum ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' mutant ', ' trafficking ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' peptide aminoacid sequence ', ' peptide sequence ', ' protein aminoacid sequence ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Defect ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Molecular Target ', ' T4SS ', ' Type IV Secretion System ', ' type 4 secretion system ', ' Type IV Secretion System Pathway ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' paralog ', ' paralogous gene ', ' vector ', ' feeding ', ' pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' fitness test ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' vector tick ', ' tickborne ', ' tick-borne ', ' vectorborne pathogen ', ' vector-borne pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,191250,WA-05,0.05116550667387904
"Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms Project Summary/Abstract  Biofilms are cohesive, multicellular microbial communities that are able to adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The human microbiome contains numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species that help maintain normal human physiology. On the other hand, more than half of the 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections in the US are caused by biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. The biofilm lifestyle is advantageous, because phenotypic diversity and coordination of cellular behaviors within biofilms provide bacterial populations with emergent capabilities beyond those of individual cells. For example, biofilms are orders of magnitude more tolerant towards physical, chemical, and biological stressors, most notably long-term treatments with antibiotic drugs or clearance attempts by the immune system. However, it remains largely unknown how such remarkable capabilities emerge from the behaviors of individual cells and the interactions between them. A critical barrier to rapid progress is the inability of conventional microscopes to resolve micrometer-sized bacterial cells in thick (>10 micrometers) biofilms in a non-invasive manner. The proposed research addresses this challenge by developing integrated experimental and computational technologies that enable non-invasive, 3D fluorescence imaging of pathogenic biofilms by lattice-light sheet microscopy, accurate single-cell segmentation and 3D shape measurements based on the acquired images, and simultaneous 3D tracking of thousands of cells inside biofilms. The ability to make single- cell measurements in dense microbial populations will enable researchers to correlate the spatial trajectory of each cell with that cells’ gene expression and behavioral phenotype. Such information will provide an integrated understanding of how bacteria coordinate gene expression and social behaviors in 3D space and time. A fundamental understanding of biofilm biology will help inform new strategies for harnessing the emergent functional capabilities of microbial populations and for removing pathogenic biofilms from undesired environments. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance  Bacterial biofilms are responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections, and currently used antibiotic and disinfection treatments are unable to cope with this epidemic. An integrated understanding of how individual bacterial cells act and interact with each other inside biofilms is necessary to inform new strategies for controlling biofilm growth. This project enables high-resolution, single-cell measurements inside living biofilms by developing new technologies for non-invasive biofilm imaging and computational tracking of thousands of bacterial cells in crowded environments.",Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms,10034367,R01GM139002,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disinfection ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Industrialization ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Linear Programming ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' seal ', ' Shigella flexneri ', ' S flexneri ', ' S. flexneri ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Microbial Biofilms ', ' biofilm ', ' Myxococcus xanthus ', ' M xanthus ', ' M. xanthus ', ' Custom ', ' Cell Shape ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' morphometry ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' microbial ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' model design ', ' cell dimension ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' Population ', ' community microbes ', ' microbial community ', ' cellular behavior ', ' cell behavior ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' public health relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' imaging platform ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' live cell imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' tolerance to antibiotics ', ' tolerate antibiotics ', ' antibiotic tolerance ', ' bacterial community ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' Immersion ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,302927,VA-05,0.0516587308980333
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Bacteriuria ', '

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10017203,R01HS027375,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,496235,IA-02,0.032798877861012
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Physicians ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Sputum ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Triage ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Funding ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Proteome ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' International ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' disease phenotype ', ' prospective ', ' Coupling ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' biosignature ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' protein markers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,CA-12,-0.01658844665950964
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor.

"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9854874,K08AI125682,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Red Cell ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' immunologic substance ', ' immunological substance ', ' In Vitro ', ' Indiana ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFNγ ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Training ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' parasaetemia ', ' Parasitemia ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' parasite invasion ', ' in vitro activity ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical predictors ', ' malaria transmission ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2020,185224,IN-07,0.0362014529066845
"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,9871398,K23HD100594,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colistin ', ' Colimycin ', ' Colisticin ', ' Polymyxin E ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Hand ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hygiene ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Incidence ', ' India ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9957109,R01GM117241,"['Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Anopheles Genus ', ' Anopheles ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Beds ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecticide Resistance ', ' insecticide resistant ', ' Insecticides ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Plasmodium ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Anopheles gambiae ', ' tool ', ' Catalogs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Mosquito-borne disease ', ' Mosquito-borne infectious disease ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' fight against ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' human disease ', ' resistance allele ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' malaria transmission ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' malaria infection ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' malaria mosquito ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,295000,OR-04,0.0395145256528307
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community.

"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen over the last four months represents a nearly unprecedented challenge for the infectious disease modelling community. This pandemic has benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data has often outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-time infectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — these methods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and so do not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leverage the wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policy interventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms to forecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must use sound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real- time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2) to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions in impacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base for continued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an emerging public health crisis. A fundamental challenge is how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about managing resources, improving health outcomes, and controlling further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Real-time forecasting and flexible mechanistic models to understand the disease dynamics can provide policy-makers tools to manage public response. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt existing statistical modeling frameworks and develop new ones for making forecasts of COVID-19 in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios,10150377,R35GM119582,"['Award ', ' Budgets ', ' Calibration ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dengue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evaluation Methodology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Distance ', ' sound ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Thailand ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Endemic Diseases ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' reproductive ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Flu epidemic ', ' influenza epidemic ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model design ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' rapid growth ', ' flu prevention ', ' Influenza prevention ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Natural experiment ', ' real world application ', ' evidence base ', ' seasonal flu ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' surveillance data ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' deep learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' data pipeline ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' data dissemination ', ' Dengue disease ', ' breakbone fever ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2020,78507,MA-02,0.034848008627801866
"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Central Nervous System Viral

"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,9862588,R01HD100542,"['Antibodies ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bifidobacterium ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological

"Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Outbreak detection in most hospitals uses outdated methods. The declining costs of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens and the wide-spread use of the electronic medical record (EMR) provide a unique opportunity to enhance outbreak detection in hospitals and therefore reduce the number of infections. Accordingly, we propose to establish the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT), which uses routine WGS of bacterial pathogens and machine learning and data mining of the EMR to dramatically increase capacity to detect healthcare-associated outbreaks.",Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-Associated Transmission of Infection,9984252,R01AI127472,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae ', ' K pneumoniae ', ' K. pneumoniae ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Charge ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economic Models ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Patients ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Enterococcus faecalis ', ' E faecalis ', ' E. faecalis ', ' S faecalis ', ' S. faecalis ', ' Streptococcus Group D ', ' Streptococcus faecalis ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Enterobacter cloacae ', ' E cloacae ', ' E. cloacae ', ' Enterococcus faecium ', ' E faecium ', ' E. faecium ', ' S faceium ', ' S faecium ', ' S. faceium ', ' S. faecium ', ' Streptococcus faceium ', ' Streptococcus faecium ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' economic analysis ', ' economic evaluation ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Period Analysis ', ' A baumanni ', ' A baumannii ', ' A. baumanni ', ' A. baumannii ', ' A.baumannii ', ' Acinetobacter baumanni ', ' Acinetobacter baumannii ', ' K oxytoca ', ' K. oxytoca ', ' Klebsiella oxytoca ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' A aerogenes ', ' A. aerogenes ', ' Aerobacter aerogeness ', ' E aerogenes ', ' E. aerogenes ', ' Enterobacter aerogenes ', ' K aerogenes ', ' K mobilus ', ' K. aerogenes ', ' K. mobilus ', ' Klebsiella mobilus ', ' Klebsiella aerogenes ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' MRSA ', ' Methicillin Resistant S Aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9985737,R01AI127375,"['Alleles ', '

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Aspergillus ', ' Azoles ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Candida ', ' Monilia ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' fungus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mycoses ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' fungal infection ', ' fungus infection ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Polyenes ', ' Public Health ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Bacterial RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' RNA, Ribosomal, 28S ', ' Sputum ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Bronchioalveolar Lavage ', ' Bronchopulmonary Lavage ', ' Lung Lavage ', ' bronchopulmonary lavage therapy ', ' Bronchoalveolar Lavage ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Zygomycetes ', ' Class Zygomycetes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' anti-microbial susceptibility ', ' Antimicrobial susceptibility ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' prophylactic ', ' Pattern ', ' Test Result ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' microbial ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' anti-fungal therapy ', ' fungal infectious disease treatment ', ' Antifungal Therapy ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Ig Variable Region ', ' Immunoglobulin V ', ' Variable Region ', ' Immunoglobulin Variable Region ', ' Skin ', ' Swab ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transcript ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' efflux pump ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' patient population ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' nanostring ', ' nano-string ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' random forest ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' C auris ', ' C. auris ', ' Candida auris ', ' computational pipelines ', ' ']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,MA-07,-0.003849572223751738
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,10017191,R01DK114038,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bacteria ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Societies ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Voting ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' prophylactic ', ' Techniques ', ' Probiotics ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' metagenome ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' metagenome sequencing ', ' metagenomic sequencing ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' clinical remission ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' learning network ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' fecal microbial transplantation ', ' fecal microbiome transplantation ', ' fecal microbiota transplant ', ' fecal microbiota transplantation ', ' fecal transplant ', ' fecal transplantation ', ' probiotic therapeutic ', ' probiotic therapy ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microbiota ', ' sham group ', ' placebo group ', ' bacterial community ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,254179,NY-13,0.04382693727323055
"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,10018461,F31AI133871,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Babesia microti ', ' Babesiosis ', ' Babesia infection ', ' Babesia parasite infection ', ' Piroplasmosis ', ' infected with Babesia ', ' Behavior ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Entomology ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' granulocyte ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' geographic population ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Temperature ', ' Ticks ', ' Ixodida ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' tickborne infection ', ' Tick-Borne Infections ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' I scapularis ', ' I. scapularis ', ' Ixodes scapularis ', ' Ixodid ticks ', ' blacklegged tick ', ' Black-legged Tick ', ' A phagocytophila ', ' A phagocytophilum ', ' A. phagocytophila ', ' A. phagocytophilum ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' model design ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' environmental change ', ' Ecological Change ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' anthropogenic ', ' anthropogenesis ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' human disease ', ' vector transmission ', ' spatial temporal variation ', ' demographics ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Anaplasmosis ', ' decision tree learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' infection risk ', ' regression trees ', ' tickborne pathogen ', ' tick-borne pathogen ', ' tick bite ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,38185,PA-03,0.041881509197690195
"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity. GAT will particularly benefit researchers working in preclinical stages of drug development who require rapid, sensitive, and reliable results to inform decisions about which targets to advance to clinical trial testing.",Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies,10011686,R43AI152894,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Epidemic ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' infection with HBV ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' Chronic Hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Learning ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Semantics ', ' Serotyping ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccines ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Viral hepatitis ', ' hepatitis virus infection ', ' Virion ', ' Virus Particle ', ' Virus ', ' Infection Control ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Trust ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' virus resistance ', ' viral resistance ', ' Viral ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' structural genomics ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' commercialization ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' coinfection ', ' co-infection ', ' HCV/HIV ', ' HIV and HCV ', ' HIV and hepatitis C ', ' HIV-HCV ', ' HIV/Hepatitis C ', ' HIV/HCV ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' HBV ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' persistent infection ', ' chronic infection ', ' neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' contig ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,"GATACA, LLC",R43,2020,267225,VA-09,-0.01382472563625404
