"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. ",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7761665,R01DA020949,"['Diagnosis ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Brain region ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' improved ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Left ', ' Link ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Animals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' assault ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' middle column ', ' monoamine ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' novel ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Accounting ', ' Computer Architectures ', ' network architecture ', ' approach behavior ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' brain behavior ', ' neuropsychological ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' ']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2010,214701,NY-01,-0.026189039863234755
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           ",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7883451,F31MH086255,"['Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Behavioral ', ' Food ', ' Gambling ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Animals ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Psychology ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' preference ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Proxy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Structure ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' deprivation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' reward processing ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,28699,NC-04,0.009696967287057528
"Spatiotemporal dynamics of striatal dopamine release in reinforcement learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Classical conditioning is arguably the most fundamental tool we possess for adapting our behavior to a changing environment. Appetitive classical conditioning can be thought of as the process that establishes a learned association between reinforcement and the stimuli in the environment that signal its availability. This form of ""reinforcement learning"" provides organisms with a potent means to use predictive information to mold and guide preparatory action in an effort to maximize reward. The past three decades have been marked by major advances in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie reinforcement learning. In particular, short ""phasic"" bursts of neuronal activity in dopamine neurons, which are thought to produce rapid and transient increases in extracellular dopamine concentration throughout the striatum, have received considerable attention as a necessary component of the reinforcement process for both natural and drug reward. The central dogma in catecholamine research has held that dopamine transmission proceeds as a uniform broadcast signal from the midbrain to all target structures in the forebrain. However, there is mounting evidence that separate nuclei within the striatum may receive differential signals in response to primary rewards and conditioned cues at different stages in the learning process. It is hypothesized that this regional specificity in the dynamics and stability of dopamine signaling corresponds to the largely segregated roles in both learning and behavioral control that dopamine may play in these structures. The current proposal will test these hypotheses with three specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the impact of learning history and specific features of the task on the stability of phasic dopamine in the ventral striatum. Aim 2 will examine the influence of phasic dopamine on the activation of the striatum during different stages of learning and assess the coincident regional control of behavior. Aim 3 will examine phasic dopamine release in the ventral and dorsal striatum during multiple stages of reinforcement learning (acquisition, extended training and extinction) with the goal of correlating and comparing the development of specific behaviors to the profile of phasic signaling in each structure.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although adaptive under normal circumstances, reinforcement learning is one of several contributing factors to the powerful control drug-related stimuli have over drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors in many models of addiction.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors.

"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized.

To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls.

The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. In this functional neuroimaging research we will shift the research focus to abstract positive and negative reinforcers (emotional stimuli used to change behavior) and use sophisticated computer science algorithms to predict self-control. Thereby, integrating multimodal and cutting-edge behavioral and brain experimentation and analyses in humans, we will explore common signatures of disrupted self-regulation in two disorders of the most pressing public health concern.           In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.              Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.                   Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.        In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. In this functional neuroimaging research we will shift the research focus to abstract positive and negative reinforcers (emotional stimuli used to change behavior) and use sophisticated computer science algorithms to predict self-control. Thereby, integrating multimodal and cutting-edge behavioral and brain experimentation and analyses in humans, we will explore common signatures of disrupted self-regulation in two disorders of the most pressing public health concern.         ",Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I,8658909,R21DA034954,[''],NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2012,442820,NY-13,0.050723054923082204
"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                   The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction.

"Spatiotemporal dynamics of striatal dopamine release in reinforcement learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Classical conditioning is arguably the most fundamental tool we possess for adapting our behavior to a changing environment. Appetitive classical conditioning can be thought of as the process that establishes a learned association between reinforcement and the stimuli in the environment that signal its availability. This form of ""reinforcement learning"" provides organisms with a potent means to use predictive information to mold and guide preparatory action in an effort to maximize reward. The past three decades have been marked by major advances in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie reinforcement learning. In particular, short ""phasic"" bursts of neuronal activity in dopamine neurons, which are thought to produce rapid and transient increases in extracellular dopamine concentration throughout the striatum, have received considerable attention as a necessary component of the reinforcement process for both natural and drug reward. The central dogma in catecholamine research has held that dopamine transmission proceeds as a uniform broadcast signal from the midbrain to all target structures in the forebrain. However, there is mounting evidence that separate nuclei within the striatum may receive differential signals in response to primary rewards and conditioned cues at different stages in the learning process. It is hypothesized that this regional specificity in the dynamics and stability of dopamine signaling corresponds to the largely segregated roles in both learning and behavioral control that dopamine may play in these structures. The current proposal will test these hypotheses with three specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the impact of learning history and specific features of the task on the stability of phasic dopamine in the ventral striatum. Aim 2 will examine the influence of phasic dopamine on the activation of the striatum during different stages of learning and assess the coincident regional control of behavior. Aim 3 will examine phasic dopamine release in the ventral and dorsal striatum during multiple stages of reinforcement learning (acquisition, extended training and extinction) with the goal of correlating and comparing the development of specific behaviors to the profile of phasic signaling in each structure.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although adaptive under normal circumstances, reinforcement learning is one of several contributing factors to the powerful control drug-related stimuli have over drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors in many models of addiction. The phasic activation of the neuromodulator dopamine is implicated in both reinforcement learning and many aspects of drug abuse. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the contribution of phasic dopamine release in specific brain regions to reinforcement and behavioral control.

"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.              The project has two target application domains.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG  Project Summary/Abstract Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.  Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.                ",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,8573671,R01MH101487,"['Reactive Disorders ', ' Adjustment Disorders ', ' Affect ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Perception ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Occupational ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood alteration ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Illness impact ', ' Social Functioning ', ' functional outcomes ', ' negative mood ', ' Outcome ', ' cognitive system ', ' Affective ', ' cognitive control ', ' tool development ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,627944,IL-07,0.04494243233616446
"Spatiotemporal dynamics of striatal dopamine release in reinforcement learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Classical conditioning is arguably the most fundamental tool we possess for adapting our behavior to a changing environment. Appetitive classical conditioning can be thought of as the process that establishes a learned association between reinforcement and the stimuli in the environment that signal its availability. This form of ""reinforcement learning"" provides organisms with a potent means to use predictive information to mold and guide preparatory action in an effort to maximize reward. The past three decades have been marked by major advances in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie reinforcement learning. In particular, short ""phasic"" bursts of neuronal activity in dopamine neurons, which are thought to produce rapid and transient increases in extracellular dopamine concentration throughout the striatum, have received considerable attention as a necessary component of the reinforcement process for both natural and drug reward. The central dogma in catecholamine research has held that dopamine transmission proceeds as a uniform broadcast signal from the midbrain to all target structures in the forebrain. However, there is mounting evidence that separate nuclei within the striatum may receive differential signals in response to primary rewards and conditioned cues at different stages in the learning process. It is hypothesized that this regional specificity in the dynamics and stability of dopamine signaling corresponds to the largely segregated roles in both learning and behavioral control that dopamine may play in these structures. The current proposal will test these hypotheses with three specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the impact of learning history and specific features of the task on the stability of phasic dopamine in the ventral striatum. Aim 2 will examine the influence of phasic dopamine on the activation of the striatum during different stages of learning and assess the coincident regional control of behavior. Aim 3 will examine phasic dopamine release in the ventral and dorsal striatum during multiple stages of reinforcement learning (acquisition, extended training and extinction) with the goal of correlating and comparing the development of specific behaviors to the profile of phasic signaling in each structure.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although adaptive under normal circumstances, reinforcement learning is one of several contributing factors to the powerful control drug-related stimuli have over drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors in many models of addiction. The phasic activation of the neuromodulator dopamine is implicated in both reinforcement learning and many aspects of drug abuse. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the contribution of phasic dopamine release in specific brain regions to reinforcement and behavioral control.

"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.        In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. In this functional neuroimaging research we will shift the research focus to abstract positive and negative reinforcers (emotional stimuli used to change behavior) and use sophisticated computer science algorithms to predict self-control. Thereby, integrating multimodal and cutting-edge behavioral and brain experimentation and analyses in humans, we will explore common signatures of disrupted self-regulation in two disorders of the most pressing public health concern.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8473286,R01MH098039,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Family ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Weight ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' selective attention ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' Visual attention ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' oculomotor ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' discounting ', ' frontal eye fields ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' attentional modulation ', ' lateral intraparietal area ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,384000,NY-13,0.013515172162400781
"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets.

"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8686083,R01MH098039,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Family ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Weight ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' selective attention ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' Visual attention ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' oculomotor ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' discounting ', ' frontal eye fields ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' attentional modulation ', ' lateral intraparietal area ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,400000,NY-13,0.013515172162400781

"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI.

Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8901369,R44DA035051,"['Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Klofenil ', ' 1H-Imidazol-2-amine, N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro- ', ' Clonidine ', ' Cognition ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Decision Theory ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' N-Methyl-gamma-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)benzenepropanamine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Industry ', ' Ligands ', ' Marketing ', ' Bicyclo(2.2.1)heptan-2-amine, N,2,3,3-tetramethyl- ', ' Mecamylamine ', ' Methods ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Naloxone ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Desmethylamitriptylin ', ' Desitriptyline ', ' 1-Propanamine, 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl- ', ' Nortriptyline ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Rewards ', ' Science ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' antianxiety agent ', ' Minor Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Anxiolytics ', ' Anxiolytic Agents ', ' Anti-Anxiety Drugs ', ' Anti-Anxiety Agents ', ' Moclobamide ', ' Benzamide, 4-Chloro-N-(2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl)- ', ' Moclobemide ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' buproprion ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Bupropion ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' Discipline ', ' Withdrawal ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Nicotinic Cholinergic Agonists ', ' Nicotinic Agonists ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Agonists ', ' GABA Receptor Agonists ', ' GABA Agonists ', ' Agonist ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' database management ', ' Data Base Management ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' nicotine abuse ', ' drug abuse nicotine ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Academia ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' varenicline ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' combat ', ' FDA approved ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public-private partnership ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2014,691074,NJ-05,0.02001413589597884
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies.

"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8856663,R01MH098039,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Family ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Weight ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' selective attention ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' Visual attention ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' oculomotor ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' discounting ', ' frontal eye fields ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' attentional modulation ', ' lateral intraparietal area ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,400000,NY-13,0.013515172162400781
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery. Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8934076,R44DA035051,"['Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Klofenil ', ' 1H-Imidazol-2-amine, N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro- ', ' Clonidine ', ' Cognition ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Decision Theory ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' N-Methyl-gamma-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)benzenepropanamine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Industry ', ' Ligands ', ' Marketing ', ' Bicyclo(2.2.1)heptan-2-amine, N,2,3,3-tetramethyl- ', ' Mecamylamine ', ' Methods ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Naloxone ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Desmethylamitriptylin ', ' Desitriptyline ', ' 1-Propanamine, 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl- ', ' Nortriptyline ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Rewards ', ' Science ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' antianxiety agent ', ' Minor Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Anxiolytics ', ' Anxiolytic Agents ', ' Anti-Anxiety Drugs ', ' Anti-Anxiety Agents ', ' Moclobamide ', ' Benzamide, 4-Chloro-N-(2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl)- ', ' Moclobemide ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' Discipline ', ' Withdrawal ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Nicotinic Cholinergic Agonists ', ' Nicotinic Agonists ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Agonists ', ' GABA Receptor Agonists ', ' GABA Agonists ', ' Agonist ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' database management ', ' Data Base Management ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' nicotine abuse ', ' drug abuse nicotine ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Academia ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' varenicline ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' combat ', ' FDA approved ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public-private partnership ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2015,915977,NJ-05,0.02001413589597884
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Electromyography ', ' Emotions ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' emotional style ', ' emotional adaptation ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Affective ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' public health relevance ', ' standardize measure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,WI-02,0.05579352348065921
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.                ",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,8814777,R01MH071589,"['amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Motivation ', ' Paper ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Punishment ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Stimulus ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' Graph ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Aversive Stimulus ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' motivated behavior ', ' motivational processes ', ' emotional stimulus ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2015,561912,MD-05,0.0686861263324042
"The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing,8937324,R01MH078829,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Emotions ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Foundations ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Perception ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Pupil ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' BDNF ', ' Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' Inferior ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' early childhood ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' 1 year old ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' AVPR1A ', ' AVPR1 ', ' AVPR1A gene ', ' Dopamine Receptor D4 Gene ', ' DRD4 ', ' D4DR Gene ', ' D(4) Dopamine Receptor Gene ', ' D(2C) Dopamine Receptor Gene ', ' DRD4 gene ', ' RGS2 ', ' G0S8 ', ' RGS2 gene ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 year old ', ' Affective ', ' language onset ', ' stimulus processing ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,112804,MA-07,0.047816542892839896
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Electromyography ', ' Emotions ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' emotional style ', ' emotional adaptation ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Affective ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' public health relevance ', ' standardize measure ', ' cognitive task ', ' neural correlate ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' symptomatology ', ' prognostic significance ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,WI-02,0.05579352348065921
"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,9065984,R01MH098039,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Family ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Weight ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' selective attention ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' Visual attention ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' oculomotor ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' discounting ', ' frontal eye fields ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' attentional modulation ', ' attention modulation ', ' lateral intraparietal area ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' attentional control ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,400000,NY-13,0.013515172162400781
"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deﬁne speciﬁc frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proﬁles of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deﬁne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiﬁed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ﬁndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiﬁcant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiﬁcation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' bipolar depressed ', ' Bipolar Depression ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' sugar ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' neuropathology ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Behavioral ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Bipolar I ', ' Bipolar 1 ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,CA-33,0.021445582084142063
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness.

"Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology.  As a result, treatments for humans are often developed based on animal addiction models.  However, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  Some researchers suggest that the gap in translating pre-clinical to clinical models stems from untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive substrates on the modeled tasks.  Therefore, there is a need for research than can verify that animal and human decision-making systems are comparable, which in turn, could improve the generalizability of results across these research stages.  Effective translational paradigms are needed to test similarities (or differences) in cognitive processes across species.  The present proposal introduces a novel experiential foraging paradigm for humans, which was designed based on a go/no-go foraging paradigm for rats (Restaurant Row).  In the Restaurant Row paradigm, an animal has a fixed amount of time to traverse a circular track collecting food rewards after variable delay times from different ""restaurants."" This paradigm successfully captured individual differences in preference, as well as behavioral and neural signatures of emotional constructs (e.g.  regret, disappointment).  In the proposed human variant (called the Web-Surf task), humans make a series of go/no-go decisions as they travel between video galleries that present different types of video clips after variable delays.  The human variant was designed to mimic the rat variant while also considering natural human ethology.  Preliminary analyses in human subjects suggest the two paradigms capture similar behavioral mechanisms.  The first aim of the proposed project is to examine whether the Web- Surf task equivalently measures emotional constructs, such as regret.  The first aim also seeks to elucidate whether individual differences in behavioral task performance map onto variations in impulsive traits.  The second aim of the proposed project is to determine whether the Web-Surf task captures neural signatures of deliberation and emotional processing as seen in rats.  This will be accomplished using general linear modeling and machine learning approaches for processing functional neuroimaging data.  This task could be pivotal in reducing the gap between pre-clinical and clinical research, and more importantly, advancing the development of addiction treatments for humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology; however, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  This division may be, in part, due to untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive systems in the compared tasks.  The novel research outlined in this proposal will help improve the translation between human and nonhuman animal models, and in turn, improve treatment efficacy for these disorders.                ",Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making,9185215,F31DA040335,"['Accounting ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Ethology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Rewards ', ' Students ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' analog ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' pleasure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' graduate student ', ' Categories ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' behavioral disinhibition ', ' Disinhibition ', ' willingness ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive system ', ' stem ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' cognitive process ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2016,36927,MN-05,0.012041744391848123
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing,9033949,R01MH078829,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Emotions ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Foundations ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Perception ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Pupil ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ', ' BDNF ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' Inferior ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' early childhood ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' 1 year old ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' AVPR1A ', ' AVPR1 ', ' AVPR1A gene ', ' Dopamine Receptor D4 ', ' DRD4 ', ' D4DR ', ' DRD4 gene ', ' Regulator of G-Protein Signaling 2 ', ' RGS2 ', ' Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Phosphoprotein G0S8 ', ' RGS2 gene ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 3 year old ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' Affective ', ' language onset ', ' stimulus processing ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' signal processing ', ' anxious behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,871361,MA-07,0.047816542892839896
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.            ",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9027247,R01MH060952,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' Marriage ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Manic ', ' instrument ', ' Figs ', ' Figs - dietary ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Sampling ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric bipolar disorder ', ' childhood bipolar disorder ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' reward processing ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' attentional control ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1364412,PA-18,0.04518001737046567
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.            ",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9054574,R01DC014498,"['Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Deafness ', ' Emotions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Facial Muscles ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Logic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Parents ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' American Sign Language ', ' Sign Language ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Speech ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' base ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' interest ', ' instructor ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Academic achievement ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' face perception ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' body position ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' ']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,331310,OH-03,-0.03847578969090207
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes).

"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory process ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' distraction ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' subclinical depression ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' endophenotype ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' stimulus processing ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' operation ', ' cognitive task ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,CA-33,0.012152020179905614
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,9029353,R01MH096951,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' feature recognition ', ' feature detection ', ' content based retrieval ', ' Computer-Assisted Image Analyses ', ' Computer-Assisted Image Analysis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Head ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Running ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Personal Computers ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' skin color ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,452541,PA-18,0.05697295967495642
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Behavior ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Quality ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Measures ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' gaze ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' Participant ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' conduct problem ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,PA-18,0.027830570780318413
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9286515,R01MH112560,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Cues ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Future ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychologist ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Face Processing ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,505201,CA-18,0.08509959585999483
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study -

"Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse Abstract The experience of drug craving is known to increase drug use1-6 and relapse after treatment7-16. Specifically, drug-related stimuli are known to elicit cue-induced craving, as well as physiological and neural responses, called cue reactivity, which have all been directly linked to drug use and relapse across addictions17-35, including gambling36-39. To date, hundreds of studies investigated neural cue-reactivity; however, there is little consensus in findings, due to significant variation in methods, drug types, cue types, and analysis procedures. Further, prior meta-analyses used suboptimal methods and inclusion criteria, and were underpowered40-44. In Aim 1, we propose to use state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods45-47 to summarize findings from ~120 published imaging studies, representing >3000 participants during neural cue reactivity/cue- induced craving (and 3x larger than any prior meta-analysis). Following our prior meta-analytic work in other domains48-61, we will use optimized inclusion criteria and correction methods, and account for multiple methodological differences in studies across substances (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis) and gambling, a behavioral addiction. Further, we will test for differences across drug types (e.g., cigarettes vs. alcohol) and different cue-types (e.g., pictures vs. video) to resolve several open questions in the field (e.g., role of insula in cigarette craving vs. drug craving in general62, 63; pre-scan abstinence64, 65). In Aim 2, we will go beyond meta-analysis to address an urgent need in addiction research66: development of predictive biomarkers67-69, which are stable indicators of biological processes. Biomarkers have been developed in other areas of medicine70, and we have recently done this in pain71, negative emotion72-74, and empathy74. To do this, we will combine the meta-analytic results obtained in Aim 1 with person-level fMRI data from our lab (of cue-induced craving75-79) using machine learning models, to establish a multivariate pattern of neural activity that can predict craving self-report from neural activity – a predictive neuromarker for craving. Given the associations between neural cue reactivity, craving, and drug use outcome, a multivariate neuromarker could provide a powerful neural predictor of outcomes66, 67. Thus, in Aim 3, we will validate this neuromarker on data from two ongoing clinical trials of N=128 cigarette smokers and N=150 cocaine users collected at Yale's Psychotherapy Development Center (P50 DA09241; Center PI: Carroll; Project PI: Kober). Here, the neuromarker will be used on pre-treatment fMRI cue-reactivity data to predict both self-reported craving and long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., cocaine abstinence). The validated neuromarker will provide well-defined brain targets that can then be used to test the efficacy of interventions to reduce craving and drug use, such as pharmacotherapies, brain stimulation, or cognitive training, and to monitor patient progress in both research and clinical settings. ! Project Narrative Among substance users, exposure to drug cues is associated with neural cue reactivity and cue-induced craving, both of which are directly linked to addiction severity and relapse after treatment. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods to establish a consistent neural pattern associated with cue reactivity and cue-induced craving. Then we will validate it using recently-collected imaging data – moving towards a predictive biomarker of drug craving, which can be used to investigate brain processes related to treatment efficacy and drug use outcomes in research as well as clinical settings.",Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse,9286017,R01DA043690,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cocaine ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Cues ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gambling ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Cocaine Users ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' drug craving ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Cigarette ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Cannabis ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cognitive training ', ' drug relapse ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Abstinence ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' efficacy testing ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' neural correlate ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biomarker development ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,450712,CT-03,0.002808649230661974
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,9283803,R01MH112517,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' age group ', ' middle childhood ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' movie ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' face perception ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' social neuroscience ', ' positive mood ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' early adolescence ', ' graph theory ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,675505,MD-05,0.06591842681458271
"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases. We will study how the brain codes the emotional content of speech and how stimulating specific brain areas can potentially improve this process. !",Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain,9373513,R21MH114166,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Affect ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory area ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Female ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Judgment ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Auditory ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical property ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' sensory system ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' neural stimulation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' sensory input ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2017,253863,NY-03,-0.035715119406317455
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms.

"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here. Specifically, brain connections with the  prefrontal cortex in females explain how anxious they report being but we do not see this effect in  males. With this information, we can then better understand what goes wrong in the brains of  individuals with major depression and anxiety disorders.",Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning,9499980,R56MH080716,"['Affect ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cues ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Female ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Supervision ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Failure ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' Same-sex ', ' social situation ', ' anxious ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' social learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R56,2017,405000,NH-02,0.02207103999183902
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Emotions ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Human Volunteers ', ' In Vitro ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Personhood ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Collection ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' decision research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' brain machine interface ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' volunteer ', ' brain research ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard measure ', ' neuroethics ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,471000,CA-18,0.018729856003837107
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall

"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9199411,R01DC014498,"['Algorithms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Deafness ', ' Emotions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Facial Muscles ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Logic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Parents ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Sign Language ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' base ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' interest ', ' instructor ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' experience ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' face perception ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Access to Information ', ' outreach to information ', ' body position ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Articulation ', ' American Sign Language ', ' ']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,319382,OH-03,-0.03847578969090207
"Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse Abstract The experience of drug craving is known to increase drug use1-6 and relapse after treatment7-16. Specifically, drug-related stimuli are known to elicit cue-induced craving, as well as physiological and neural responses, called cue reactivity, which have all been directly linked to drug use and relapse across addictions17-35, including gambling36-39. To date, hundreds of studies investigated neural cue-reactivity; however, there is little consensus in findings, due to significant variation in methods, drug types, cue types, and analysis procedures. Further, prior meta-analyses used suboptimal methods and inclusion criteria, and were underpowered40-44. In Aim 1, we propose to use state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods45-47 to summarize findings from ~120 published imaging studies, representing >3000 participants during neural cue reactivity/cue- induced craving (and 3x larger than any prior meta-analysis). Following our prior meta-analytic work in other domains48-61, we will use optimized inclusion criteria and correction methods, and account for multiple methodological differences in studies across substances (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis) and gambling, a behavioral addiction. Further, we will test for differences across drug types (e.g., cigarettes vs. alcohol) and different cue-types (e.g., pictures vs. video) to resolve several open questions in the field (e.g., role of insula in cigarette craving vs. drug craving in general62, 63; pre-scan abstinence64, 65). In Aim 2, we will go beyond meta-analysis to address an urgent need in addiction research66: development of predictive biomarkers67-69, which are stable indicators of biological processes. Biomarkers have been developed in other areas of medicine70, and we have recently done this in pain71, negative emotion72-74, and empathy74. To do this, we will combine the meta-analytic results obtained in Aim 1 with person-level fMRI data from our lab (of cue-induced craving75-79) using machine learning models, to establish a multivariate pattern of neural activity that can predict craving self-report from neural activity – a predictive neuromarker for craving. Given the associations between neural cue reactivity, craving, and drug use outcome, a multivariate neuromarker could provide a powerful neural predictor of outcomes66, 67. Thus, in Aim 3, we will validate this neuromarker on data from two ongoing clinical trials of N=128 cigarette smokers and N=150 cocaine users collected at Yale's Psychotherapy Development Center (P50 DA09241; Center PI: Carroll; Project PI: Kober). Here, the neuromarker will be used on pre-treatment fMRI cue-reactivity data to predict both self-reported craving and long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., cocaine abstinence). The validated neuromarker will provide well-defined brain targets that can then be used to test the efficacy of interventions to reduce craving and drug use, such as pharmacotherapies, brain stimulation, or cognitive training, and to monitor patient progress in both research and clinical settings. ! Project Narrative Among substance users, exposure to drug cues is associated with neural cue reactivity and cue-induced craving, both of which are directly linked to addiction severity and relapse after treatment. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods to establish a consistent neural pattern associated with cue reactivity and cue-induced craving. Then we will validate it using recently-collected imaging data – moving towards a predictive biomarker of drug craving, which can be used to investigate brain processes related to treatment efficacy and drug use outcomes in research as well as clinical settings.",Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse,9489234,R01DA043690,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cocaine ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Cues ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Gambling ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Cocaine Users ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' drug craving ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Cigarette ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Cannabis ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cognitive training ', ' drug relapse ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Abstinence ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' efficacy testing ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' neural correlate ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biomarker development ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' imaging study ', ' cue to smoke ', ' smoking cue ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,430771,CT-03,0.002808649230661974
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues.

Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9487048,R01MH112560,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Cues ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Future ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychologist ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Face Processing ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,474391,CA-18,0.08509959585999483
"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.                ",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9380291,F32HD087028,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Electrical Stimulation of the Brain ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' memory retrieval ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' trial comparing ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' training opportunity ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58002,CA-18,-0.006599958712342225
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9527977,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chlorides ', ' High Pressure Liquid Chromatography ', ' High Speed Liquid Chromatography ', ' High Performance Liquid Chromatography ', ' HPLC ', ' classical conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Cues ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' Glutamates ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Serotonin ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' reinforcer ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' drug seeking behavior ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Stable Isotope Labeling ', ' Address ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' motivated behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Heritability ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' neural correlate ', ' incentive salience ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' high dimensionality ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,208699,MI-12,0.050629079229435166
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9576355,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' coping ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,672594,MI-12,0.024872898913171477
"Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success The United States has experienced a four-fold increase in medical opioid use over the last two  decades. Medical opioid abuse and addiction have increased and afflict 5% and 2% of US adults  respectively; heroin addiction afflicts 0.5% of US adults. In 2016, >39,000 US individuals died of  a medical opioid, illicit opiate or synthetic opioid overdose, an increase of 18% from 2015. While  opioid addiction treatment admissions and treatment capacity have increased many-fold over the last  two decades, patient needs greatly exceed capacity. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) approaches for opioid use disorder include three approved  pharmacotherapies combined with psychosocial and supportive therapies. Active investigations are  evaluating established and novel therapies for opioid detoxification prior to MAT. MATs have  established but limited efficacy in treating opioid use disorders compared to placebo  pharmacotherapy. Patients treated with MATs have mortality rates during and after treatment that  exceed population mortality rates. Improving efficacy through personalized treatment is essential  to optimize MAT resources and reduce mortality. “Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success” offers a data science solution that aligns  with NIDA priorities and Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidance to expand use of MAT, and with HHS  priorities to support cutting edge research on pain and addiction. Our overall aim is to decode the  predictors of MAT success and enable health care providers to improve treatment efficacy using  accurate forecasting. In Aim 1, we will create a platform for applying learning algorithms to existing and future opioid  addiction treatment data. We will organize and merge clinical, treatment, and outcome variables  from clinical trials of opioid addiction treatment publicly available through the NIDA Data Share  resource. We will import these data into a database optimized for high dimensional data analysis.  Workflows will be developed to apply multiple Bayesian learning algorithms to the data. In Aim 2,  using the biosignature learning platform, we will identify sets of variables that together predict  opioid addiction treatment success. We will apply this platform to each trial independently, and  then to multiple trials in an integrative analysis. The learned biosignatures will be ranked by how  well they predict treatment success. The best models will be incorporated into a proof-of-concept calculator. The calculator will provide treatment success scores based on the  characteristics of new patients. We will present the prototype to multiple stakeholders for  assessment. At the end of Phase I, we will have created a biosignature learning platform and a proof-of-concept  opioid addiction treatment success calculator. We plan to fully develop these components with  additional datasets and variables in Phase II. Our commercial goal is to develop licensable and  easily deployable algorithms for healthcare networks treating opioid addiction.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Behavior ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Quality ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Measures ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' gaze ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' Participant ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' conduct problem ', ' tutorial support ', ' tutoring ', ' protective factors ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,PA-18,0.027830570780318413
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9529387,K23MH108656,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Contingent Negative Variation ', ' Readiness Potential ', ' Bereitschaftspotential ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fractionation ', ' Fractionation Radiotherapy ', ' FRACN ', ' Chemical Fractionation ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' locus ceruleus structure ', ' blue nucleus ', ' Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis ', ' Locus Coeruleus ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' cognitive function ', ' millisecond ', ' Msec ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' cognitive training ', ' Instruction ', ' computerized ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' Affective ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' stem ', ' cognitive control ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' neurofeedback ', ' attentional control ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' secondary analysis ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translational research program ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192351,OR-03,-0.012960537154607253
"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases. We will study how the brain codes the emotional content of speech and how stimulating specific brain areas can potentially improve this process. !",Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain,9520422,R21MH114166,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Female ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Judgment ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Superior temporal gyrus ', ' Comprehension ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Auditory ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical property ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' sensory system ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' neural stimulation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' sensory input ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2018,202112,NY-03,-0.035715119406317455
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony.

"Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders NIDA's strategic planning emphasizes the need to increase the real-world relevance of research by prioritizing “research that incorporates real-world complexities including common comorbidities” that “interact to affect symptom profiles, illness trajectory, and treatment outcomes”.  The overall goal of the current application is to characterize the impact of the common comorbidity between psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and functional outcomes. Clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and pathways to functional outcomes in comorbid PSD+CUD will also be explored.  To do this, three existing datasets will be used, with comprehensive diagnostic, clinical, cognitive and functional data, including patients with comorbid PSD and CUD (PSD+CUD), and 3 comparison groups: patients with PSD without CUD, patients with CUD without PSD, and healthy controls without psychiatric disorder. This unique design, including all 3 relevant control groups, will allow to elucidate the combined effect of comorbid PSD+CUD, compared to the effect of PSD or CUD alone, on cognition and emotion processing, and test two alternate models: an additive model and a self- medication model. The present study will focus on 3 specific aims: 1) To characterize sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD; 2) To characterize cognitive and emotion processing impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD; 3) To characterize functional impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD, and to identify predictors and pathways to social functioning. ANOVAs and Chi- square tests will be used to compare the groups on sociodemographic features, clinical features, cognitive and emotion processing performance and functional outcomes. Linear and logistic regressions, structural equation modeling and machine learning will be used to identify predictors and model pathways to functional outcomes, taking into account possible mediators.  Data from this study will increase our understanding of the impact of comorbid PSD+CUD on cognition, emotion processing and pathways to functional outcomes. We will also characterize the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD. This will allow to identify those at risk for comorbid PSD+CUD, and to tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches, targeting specific factors identified in the models. For example, cognitive and emotion processing impairments are modifiable through cognitive/emotion processing remediation strategies. The overall goal of the current application is to examine the impact of the common comorbidity of psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and social functioning. We will also characterize the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of PSD+CUD and explore predictors and pathways to functional outcomes. Understanding the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and the factors that underlie functional outcomes, will allow to identify those at risk and tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches.","Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders",9599895,R03DA045094,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Chi-Square Tests ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' indexing ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' male ', ' Nicotine ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Self Medication ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Performance ', ' research study ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cannabis ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' comparison group ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' remediation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' cocaine use ', ' precision prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' Patient risk ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2018,127125,NY-13,0.024521637502311504
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9238947,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cues ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' expectation ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,777587,NY-13,0.03875184107383974
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand.

The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential.

"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9345313,F31DA042574,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incentives ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Play ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Link ', ' Ingestion ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' mind control ', ' brain control ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Property ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Brain region ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Cognitive ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive task ', ' graph theory ', ' ']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,MO-01,0.018510128462326504
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.

"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Emotions ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Human Volunteers ', ' In Vitro ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Personhood ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Collection ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' decision research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' brain machine interface ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' volunteer ', ' brain research ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard measure ', ' neuroethics ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' optogenetics ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,CA-18,0.018729856003837107
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9523855,R01MH113622,"['Accidents ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Qualifying ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' in vivo ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Process ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' negative mood ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Heritability ', ' Affective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' traumatic event ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' laboratory training ', ' lab experience ', ' laboratory experience ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594230,OH-13,0.07429186558332376
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9487760,R01MH060952,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Cognition ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Irritable Mood ', ' Marriage ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Categories ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sampling ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric bipolar disorder ', ' childhood bipolar disorder ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' attentional control ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,1272933,PA-18,0.04518001737046567
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9470193,F31HL140943,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alexithymias ', ' Alexithymia ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' elevated tg ', ' Triglycerides high ', ' Triglyceride increased ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' Raised TG ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' indexing ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Binge Eating ', ' compulsive overeating ', ' compulsive feeding ', ' compulsive eating ', ' Frequencies ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostases ', ' allostasis ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' emotional experience ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' heart rate variability ', ' alcohol risk ', ' coping mechanism ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' graph theory ', ' Common Core ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38124,MA-07,0.054056208342775566
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms.

"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9716629,R21DA045146,"['L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incentives ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Phenotype ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' Serotonin ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' reinforcer ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' drug seeking behavior ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Stable Isotope Labeling ', ' Address ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' motivated behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Heritability ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' neural correlate ', ' incentive salience ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' high dimensionality ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Acetylcholine ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chlorides ', ' High Speed Liquid Chromatography ', ' High Performance Liquid Chromatography ', ' HPLC ', ' High Pressure Liquid Chromatography ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' glutamatergic ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2019,233699,MI-12,0.050629079229435166
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9840077,R01DA047851,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Habits ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Motivation ', ' Negative Reinforcements ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Nicotine ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' reinforcer ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Transcend ', ' interest ', ' Brain scan ', ' animal data ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' drug seeking behavior ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Regulation ', ' craving ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' negative emotional state ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Abstinence ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' cocaine use ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' anxious ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' individual patient ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' comorbid depression ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' substance misuse ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' ']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,621348,NY-12,-0.009463115069761422
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9769513,F31HL140943,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alexithymias ', ' Alexithymia ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' increased triglycerides ', ' high triglycerides ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' elevated tg ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' Raised TG ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' indexing ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Binge Eating ', ' compulsive overeating ', ' compulsive feeding ', ' compulsive eating ', ' Frequencies ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostasis ', ' allostases ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' emotional experience ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' heart rate variability ', ' alcohol risk ', ' coping mechanism ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' graph theory ', ' Common Core ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38616,MA-07,0.054056208342775566
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors.

"Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse Abstract The experience of drug craving is known to increase drug use1-6 and relapse after treatment7-16. Specifically, drug-related stimuli are known to elicit cue-induced craving, as well as physiological and neural responses, called cue reactivity, which have all been directly linked to drug use and relapse across addictions17-35, including gambling36-39. To date, hundreds of studies investigated neural cue-reactivity; however, there is little consensus in findings, due to significant variation in methods, drug types, cue types, and analysis procedures. Further, prior meta-analyses used suboptimal methods and inclusion criteria, and were underpowered40-44. In Aim 1, we propose to use state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods45-47 to summarize findings from ~120 published imaging studies, representing >3000 participants during neural cue reactivity/cue- induced craving (and 3x larger than any prior meta-analysis). Following our prior meta-analytic work in other domains48-61, we will use optimized inclusion criteria and correction methods, and account for multiple methodological differences in studies across substances (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis) and gambling, a behavioral addiction. Further, we will test for differences across drug types (e.g., cigarettes vs. alcohol) and different cue-types (e.g., pictures vs. video) to resolve several open questions in the field (e.g., role of insula in cigarette craving vs. drug craving in general62, 63; pre-scan abstinence64, 65). In Aim 2, we will go beyond meta-analysis to address an urgent need in addiction research66: development of predictive biomarkers67-69, which are stable indicators of biological processes. Biomarkers have been developed in other areas of medicine70, and we have recently done this in pain71, negative emotion72-74, and empathy74. To do this, we will combine the meta-analytic results obtained in Aim 1 with person-level fMRI data from our lab (of cue-induced craving75-79) using machine learning models, to establish a multivariate pattern of neural activity that can predict craving self-report from neural activity – a predictive neuromarker for craving. Given the associations between neural cue reactivity, craving, and drug use outcome, a multivariate neuromarker could provide a powerful neural predictor of outcomes66, 67. Thus, in Aim 3, we will validate this neuromarker on data from two ongoing clinical trials of N=128 cigarette smokers and N=150 cocaine users collected at Yale's Psychotherapy Development Center (P50 DA09241; Center PI: Carroll; Project PI: Kober). Here, the neuromarker will be used on pre-treatment fMRI cue-reactivity data to predict both self-reported craving and long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., cocaine abstinence). The validated neuromarker will provide well-defined brain targets that can then be used to test the efficacy of interventions to reduce craving and drug use, such as pharmacotherapies, brain stimulation, or cognitive training, and to monitor patient progress in both research and clinical settings. ! Project Narrative Among substance users, exposure to drug cues is associated with neural cue reactivity and cue-induced craving, both of which are directly linked to addiction severity and relapse after treatment. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods to establish a consistent neural pattern associated with cue reactivity and cue-induced craving. Then we will validate it using recently-collected imaging data – moving towards a predictive biomarker of drug craving, which can be used to investigate brain processes related to treatment efficacy and drug use outcomes in research as well as clinical settings.",Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning: Towards Neuromarkers of Craving and Relapse,9688971,R01DA043690,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cocaine ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Cues ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gambling ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Cocaine Users ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' drug craving ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Cigarette ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Cannabis ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cognitive training ', ' drug relapse ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Abstinence ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' efficacy testing ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' neural correlate ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biomarker development ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' imaging study ', ' smoking cue ', ' cue to smoke ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,446497,CT-03,0.002808649230661974
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Persuasion ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Behavior ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Quality ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Measures ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' gaze ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' Participant ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' conduct problem ', ' protective factors ', ' deep learning ', ' affective computing ', ' intelligent tutoring system ', ' intelligent tutor ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,PA-18,0.027830570780318413
"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9616849,F31DA042574,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Decision Making ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incentives ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Play ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Link ', ' Ingestion ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' mind control ', ' brain control ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Property ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Brain region ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive task ', ' graph theory ', ' ']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,35344,MO-01,0.018510128462326504
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9618883,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cues ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' expectation ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,720901,NY-13,0.03875184107383974
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9697234,R01MH060952,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' Irritable Mood ', ' Marriage ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' poor sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' Sampling ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' childhood bipolar disorder ', ' pediatric bipolar disorder ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' attentional control ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' recruit ', ' circadian ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,1273593,PA-18,0.04518001737046567
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9711359,R01MH119430,"['absorption ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eyebrows ', ' Eyebrow structure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Methods ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Oxyhemoglobin ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Smiling ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' emotional reaction ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' mimicry ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Head Movements ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' magnetic field ', ' dyadic interaction ', ' contagion ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' neural correlate ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,405576,CT-03,0.02963625496409877
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,9664686,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Social Development ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' age group ', ' middle childhood ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' movie ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' face perception ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Brain region ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' social neuroscience ', ' positive mood ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' early adolescence ', ' Social Processes ', ' graph theory ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,674876,MD-05,0.06591842681458271
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9768419,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Maxim ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,606526,MI-12,0.024872898913171477
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9598343,F32HD087028,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Electrical Stimulation of the Brain ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' memory retrieval ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' trial comparing ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' training opportunity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,18205,CA-18,-0.006599958712342225
"High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform Project Summary/Abstract The scale of the US opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the critical need for breakthroughs to assess compound abuse liabilities and to enable discovery of new analgesics with minimal abuse potential. We hypothesize that altered addiction-associated physiology can be modeled in co-cultured hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells and detected by profiling gene expression alterations and associated phenotypic readouts. Our proposal addresses the significant lack of physiologically-relevant tools capable of profiling relevant molecular changes that underpin addiction in the human nervous system by executing Specific Aims that encompass: (1) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; (2) execution of a phenotype-based pilot machine learning-enabled predictive abuse liability screen; and (3) combination of phenotypic profiling and gene expression analysis to characterize the molecular and cellular changes associated with compound exposure. Successful completion of our project will deliver 2 significant advances: (1) an important new technical framework to assess abuse potential of candidate therapeutics early in the development process and (2) an innovative, scalable in vitro assay platform that enables discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to mitigate addiction phenotypes. These innovations will position Cairn Biosciences to initiate drug discovery programs that will bring significant societal benefit by helping to stem the growth of the US opioid crisis and reduce the mortality rates and economic burden associated with this National Emergency. Project Narrative The ongoing opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the need for new approaches to overcome addiction and mitigate the abuse liabilities of new therapies, yet a critical barrier to progress is the lack of in vitro assays in human cells to profile the abuse liabilities of therapeutics. Our project will deliver an innovative in vitro assay platform that enables 1) the assessment of abuse liability of candidate therapeutics early in development and 2) the discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to prevent development of an addiction phenotype. These high impact advances align with government priorities such as the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) initiative and will deliver significant additional benefit to public health by enabling identification of safer new therapeutics without addictive potential.",High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform,9912598,R44DA048686,"['Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Astrocytes ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Government ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transfection ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Measurement ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependent ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' expression vector ', ' Structure ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Protein Array ', ' protein expression ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Gene Expression Alteration ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' stem ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' therapeutic candidate ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' ']",NIDA,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,323750,CA-12,0.009023205748671508
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology.

"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9675331,R01MH113622,"['Accidents ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sleep disruption ', ' poor sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Qualifying ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' in vivo ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' negative mood ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Heritability ', ' Affective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' traumatic event ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' laboratory experience ', ' laboratory training ', ' lab experience ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' recruit ', ' childhood adversity ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' ']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569073,OH-13,0.07429186558332376
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9652845,R01MH112560,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Cues ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Future ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychologist ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Running ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Social Processes ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' affective computing ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,474391,CA-18,0.08509959585999483
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Emotions ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Human Volunteers ', ' In Vitro ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Personhood ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Collection ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' decision research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' brain machine interface ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' volunteer ', ' brain research ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard measure ', ' neuroethics ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' optogenetics ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,CA-18,0.018729856003837107
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis.

"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Literature ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Coin ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' aversive conditioning ', ' Participant ', ' gang ', ' Graph ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Emotional ', ' face perception ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Aversive Stimulus ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' virtual ', ' conditioning ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' stem ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,MD-05,-0.02871907059682721
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9923725,R01MH112560,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cues ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Future ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychologist ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Social Functioning ', ' facial processing ', ' Face Processing ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Social Processes ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' affective computing ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,451783,CA-18,0.08509959585999483
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study -

"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games.

"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,9993553,R01MH118218,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Awareness ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' comparative ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' cognitive process ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' improved outcome ', ' random forest ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2020,441529,,0.044858766952932005
"Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain. Project Summary The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently made remarkable advances that resulted in new and improved algorithms and network architectures that proved efficient empirically in silico. These advances raise new questions in neurobiology: are these new algorithms used in the brain? The present study focuses on a new algorithm developed in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), called distributional RL, which outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms and is regarded as a major advancement in RL. In environments in which rewards are probabilistic with respect to its occurrence and size, traditional RL algorithms have focused on learning to predict a single quantity, the average over all potential rewards. Distributional RL, by contrast, learns to predict the entire distribution over rewards (or values) by employing multiple value predictors that together encode all possible levels of future reward concurrently. Remarkably, theoretical work has shown that a class of distributional RL, called ‘quantile distributional RL’, can arise out of a simple modification of traditional RL that introduces structured variability in dopamine reward prediction error (RPE) signals. This project set out to test the hypothesis that the brain utilizes distributional RL to predict future rewards. Aim 1 will explore the characteristics of distributional RL theoretically and make predictions that allow for testing distributional RL in the brain. Theoretical investigations and simulations will be used to determine how value representations in distributional RL differ from pre-existing population coding schemes for representing probability distributions (probabilistic population codes, distributed distributional codes, etc.). Aim 2 will examine the activity of neurons that are thought to signal RPEs and reward expectation and test various predictions of distributional RL. Specifically, the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex will be compared to key predictions of distributional RL. Aim 3 will use optogenetic manipulation to causally demonstrate the relationship between RPE signals and distributional codes. Narrative Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, anhedonia, apathy, schizophrenia, addiction, eating disorders and Parkinson’s disease. In particular, aberrant dopamine responses to salient events have been implicated in addiction, schizophrenia and other mental disorders. Understanding dopamine signaling in the healthy brain is essential to understanding states of aberrant dopamine signaling.",Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain.,9978224,R01NS116753,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' Anhedonia ', ' improved ', ' Stimulus ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' dopamine system ', ' optogenetics ', ' network architecture ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1784522,MA-05,-0.006896524344569378
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9840518,R01MH113622,"['Accidents ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Participant ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Qualifying ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' in vivo ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Process ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' negative mood ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Heritability ', ' Affective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' post-trauma stress ', ' posttrauma stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' traumatic event ', ' lab experience ', ' lab training ', ' laboratory training ', ' laboratory experience ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' recruit ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' childhood adversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,573248,OH-13,0.07429186558332376
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9819777,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' expectation ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' neural network ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,698101,NY-13,0.03875184107383974
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall

"Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction National studies show that drug use rates have increased in the last decade among women, comprising a major public health concern in the US. However, women are greatly underrepresented in neuroimaging studies, and the paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations contributes to a gap in the study of the sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Over the last decade, in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (conducted with previous support including R01DA023579, R01DA020949), we have thoroughly mapped the clinical symptoms of cocaine addiction to the neural networks underlying impairments in Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA). This model proposes that the drug assumes heightened salience at the expense of non-drug related reinforcement as associated with abnormalities in reward processing and concomitant decreases in inhibitory control, together increasing addiction severity (including craving, a proxy of relapse) in susceptible individuals. The iRISA model highlights the role of the dopaminergically innervated prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to mesolimbic and striatal subcortical regions as assessed functionally and structurally. However, the majority of this neuroimaging research has been accomplished in male individuals with cocaine use disorders (iCUD). In the current project we aim to expand the reach of iRISA by comparing equal numbers of male to female iCUD; to test this model’s generalizability (vs. drug specificity effects), we will also include individuals with opioid use disorder (iOUD). We will conduct functional MRI during reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity tasks, and, to inspect generalizability of results beyond task-related activations, during resting-state. Beyond functional activations and connectivity, anatomical scans will assess the underlying gray matter integrity. Across all aims, healthy controls will be included to establish norms. We hypothesize female iCUD to differ from male iCUD, or female controls, in a pattern indicative of enhanced vulnerability to iRISA inclusive of compensatory PFC activations and abnormalities in structural measures; iCUD vs. iOUD comparisons will be exploratory. The novelty of this proposal is further enhanced by an exploratory aim to compare, in a within- subjects design, menstrual cycle (and hormonal) effects and by developing sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to incorporate data from all imaging modalities to yield an automated group classification and addiction severity (including craving) prediction tool. Considering that the majority of research in addiction occurs in males, clarification of the sex differences in the neural underpinnings of iRISA could reinforce the importance of studying both genders and suggest that different treatment strategies may be effective in women (potentially of most impact when timed vis-à-vis menstrual cycle), contributing to the development of tailored (gender-based) treatment options. Including equal numbers of women and men would advance basic studies of drug addiction and ultimately save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects in future clinical trials. National studies show that there is more rapid increase in the use of all drugs of abuse by women compared with men, comprising a unique public health concern in the US. However, an overrepresentation of males in neuroimaging studies, and a paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations, contributes to an absence of a clear understanding of sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. The study of sex differences (and menstrual cycle/hormonal effects) in the neural underpinnings of reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity could advance basic neuroscience studies of drug addiction and save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects during future clinical (medication) trials. Ultimately, results could contribute to the development of individually tailored (gender-based) precision medicine interventions (e.g., to reduce craving).",Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction,9913128,R01DA048301,"['Future ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Luteal Phase ', ' Luteal Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Menstrual Secretory Phase ', ' Postovulatory Phase ', ' Secretory Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' psychostimulant ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Performance ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' sexually dimorphic ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Proxy ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Intoxication ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' systematic review ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' Abstinence ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drug of abuse ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' reward processing ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' treatment strategy ', ' nondrug ', ' non-drug ', ' cocaine use ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' stress reactivity ', ' neural correlate ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' symptomatology ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' ']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,689316,NY-13,0.03610270758977562
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Behavior ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Quality ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Measures ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' gaze ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' Participant ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Affective ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' conduct problem ', ' protective factors ', ' deep learning ', ' affective computing ', ' intelligent tutor ', ' intelligent tutoring system ', ' emotional functioning ', ' shared data base ', ' shared database ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,PA-18,0.027830570780318413
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms.

"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes. The NLA toolbox is a versatile analysis pipeline which leverages the structural and functional architecture of the brain and rigorous statistical testing and validation procedures to define brain-behavior relationships across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease.",Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships,10055480,K99EB029343,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Production ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Endocrine ', ' skills training ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Career Transition Award ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' analytical tool ', ' brain behavior ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' tool development ', ' longitudinal design ', ' network architecture ', ' cloud based ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' dimensional analysis ', ' connectome ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' connectomic data ', ' connectome data ', ' in silico ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,126289,MO-01,0.028240428044057662
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG.

"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

"Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning Reward learning is a fundamental cognitive function, and the brain has a dedicated neuromodulatory system – based on dopamine – that supports this process. Changes to the dopamine system that are triggered by exposure to drugs of abuse are thought to underlie the behavioral changes observed in addiction. Here we propose to use a treasure trove of previously recorded neural data from throughout the mesocorticostriatal circuitry that supports reward learning, to elucidate the computational role of each component of the circuit, their interactions, and how these components are affected by cocaine. Our brains constantly generate predictions about what rewards might be available, and compare these predictions to actual outcomes. The neuromodulator dopamine is thought to report these ‘prediction error’ signals, the result of the ongoing comparison between expected and obtained rewards, that are key to updating predictions so they are more accurate in the future. Predicting the timing of rewards, and not just their identity or value, is an important component of this process, but it remains a mystery how the brain forms and uses predictions about time in reward learning. Based on a novel theoretical model we recently developed, we will test the computational role of three key brain areas that comprise the brain circuit critical for reward learning, using a state-of-the- art methods from machine learning to jointly decode the learning processes that drive neural activity from multiple brain areas along with behavior as rats perform a reward learning task. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely important for representing high level ‘task states’ and will test for patterns in OFC neural activity that follow the hidden structure of the task. In Aim 2, we will decode the representation of reward predictions about the amount and timing of rewards, and test whether they are separable in VS neural activity. In Aim 3, we will test how activity in VS and OFC controls dopamine activity, and in particular how each input component enables prediction errors to be temporally precise. In Aim 4, we will test how exposure to cocaine changes neural activity that represents reward predictions in the VS, and the impact of this disruption on dopamine prediction errors in the VTA. This innovative multi-level study will leverage numerous existing neural and behavioral data from rats performing a well-validated reward-learning task, to reveal the computational, neural and behavioral mechanisms of the reward prediction and learning circuitry in the brain, and the source of their disruption in addiction. Dysfunction of mesolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry is implicated in addiction, and is known to produce critical deficits in timing (for example, impulsivity) and reward learning. Here we will use a treasure trove of 8 existing datasets to test novel predictions about the neural basis of timing and reward learning, employing state-of-the-art tools from machine learning to ‘decode’ reward predictions jointly from multiple brain areas and from behavior, in intact neural circuits as well as after damage from lesions or exposure to cocaine. Our findings will lay bare the neural computations that support reward prediction and will allow us to link aberrant reward learning in addiction back to its basis in the circuitry of the brain.",Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning,9947251,R01DA050647,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Odors ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' synergism ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Impulsivity ', ' theories ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' reward circuitry ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' Outcome ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drug of abuse ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' dopamine system ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' neural correlate ', ' brain circuitry ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,283500,NJ-12,0.00124482063114394
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit

"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on people’s lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10068854,F32MH122062,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' indexing ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' expectation effect ', ' nocebo ', ' placebo response ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Expectancy ', ' Mind ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' neural model ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' fusiform face area ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' pain processing ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,64926,MA-07,-0.0009802582354374615
"Can fidgeting lead to enhanced attention and emotional regulation in adult ADHD? Fidgeting is a highly common behavior, with excessive fidgeting associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies from our laboratory (1) and colleagues (2) suggest physical movement can enhance cognitive performance in children with ADHD. Hyper-sensorimotor behavior may be related to impaired regulation of arousal in the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems (3). This project will assess if frequency and characteristics of sensorimotor behavior relates to cognitive and emotional response in adults with ADHD, in a fine-grained manner, unlike other studies. We will test if intrinsic fidgeting (Aim 1) and access to a specially designed fidget device (Aim 2) modulates behavioral and physiological response in cognitively and emotionally-demanding contexts. The hype of the commercially available Fidget Cube, its competitors and fidget spinners suggest it might, but there is no systematic evidence to inform consumers, a gap, we aim to fill. ADHD is a significant problem in adulthood, with estimates of 4.4% in the population (4). It is associated with higher rates of substance use disorders, traffic accidents and employment challenges and a national annual economic impact ranging from $143 to $266 billion (5). While overt hyperactivity is mostly associated with childhood, subtler, finer-grained frequent movements (e.g., leg movements, doodling, clicking objects, tapping) are highly common in adult ADHD. Little is known about the characteristics of fidgeting in adulthood or whether it can be harnessed to enhance self-regulation with the use of an external device. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1: Assess in a randomized controlled study if a) intrinsic fidgeting and b) use of a smart fidget device improves attention, working memory, processing speed and emotional regulation in adult ADHD; Aim 2: Identify specific touch characteristics associated with cognitive and emotional regulation in adult ADHD using behavioral coding and a prototype fidget ball (developed by Co-I Isbister) with embedded pressure sensors on the fidget surface transmitting real time data to a computer for data analysis; Exploratory Aim 3: Conduct a machine learning analysis of fidgeting behavior in relation to cognitive performance and emotional regulation to: 1) automate recognition of touch features present in fidgeting in adult ADHD; 2) correlate touch sequences with cognitive performance measures and; 3) recommend fidgeting strategies that should prove effective in a given situation. This project will build upon prior work by PI Schweitzer, with her expertise in ADHD, clinical translational research and cognitive neuroscience and Co-I Isbister, with expertise in computer science and engineering, who developed sensor-enabled, smart fidget devices with the goal of improving self-regulation of mood and attention (6-9); Co-I Shapiro (10) with machine learning expertise in analyzing fidgeting behavior. This project is highly responsive to NIMH Strategic Plan Objective 3 as it will inform researchers working to develop new interventions based on behavioral and physiological markers, tailored to the individual. This project will study how fidgeting relates to cognitive and emotional functioning in adults with attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It will determine, in a laboratory setting, whether movement and access to a “fidget device” providing sensory and motor stimulation can improve cognitive and emotional regulation (including on physiological measures) in adult ADHD. We will also acquire pilot data for machine learning analyses to be used in future, large scale studies to identify gestures and touch characteristics associated with improved cognitive and emotional regulation to see if we can predict and subsequently develop recommendations to improve performance and emotional control in natural settings (e.g., home, office, college classroom) for adult ADHD.",Can fidgeting lead to enhanced attention and emotional regulation in adult ADHD?,10064501,R21MH121901,"['Accidents ', ' Traffic accidents ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Boredom ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microprocessor ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Physiology ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Task Performances ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toy ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Frequencies ', ' Tactile ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Occupational ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' processing speed ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' sensory motor system ', ' sensorimotor system ', ' computer science ', ' noradrenergic ', ' computer data analysis ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Leg ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' R21 Program ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' mood regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' prototype ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' heart rate variability ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' citizen science ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Grain ', ' social relationships ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' emotional functioning ', ' pressure sensor ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,417969,CA-03,0.01171447364032516
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics.

"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10056112,R01DA051913,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' brain tissue ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' supercomputer ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' case control ', ' Oranges ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' GTEx ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' smoke addiction ', ' smoking dependence ', ' smoking dependent ', ' smoking addiction ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid overdose ', ' addiction to cigarettes ', ' cigarette addiction ', ' random forest ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' big-data science ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' genomic locus ', ' ']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2020,597080,NC-04,-0.0040589073347475964
"The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation Project Summary  Over the course of our lifetimes, we are bound to experience distressing, negative events we would rather not remember over and over again. Importantly, there is variability in people’s ability to cope with these memories. How do people regulate negative emotional memories, and why are some people better at dealing with negative memories than others? For my dissertation, I will investigate these questions through the lens of cognitive neuroscience, specifically looking at how memory reactivation strength can predict one’s ability to deal with negative memories. Prior work from the Norman Lab has postulated a U-shaped relationship between memory reactivation strength and the fate of a memory: Moderate reactivation leads to memory weakening while strong reactivation leads to strengthening. This proposal examines the impact of memory reactivation strength in 3 studies: In Study 1, I focus on memory suppression, a coping strategy where people try to stop an unwanted memory from coming to mind after it has been triggered by a cue in the environment. I will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to relate the neural measure of memory reactivation during a memory suppression task to subsequent memory reactivation. In this study, for which data collection should be completed by the start of the F99 Phase, I will also examine the impact of inter-subject differences in depression level; prior research has shown that depressed participants appear to demonstrate a negative bias, which might be relevant to how strongly memories are reactivated. In Study 2, I will shift my focus to study cognitive reappraisal, an alternative strategy whereby participants reframe the interpretation of a negative event to mitigate the emotional intensity tied to its memory. Although this strategy requires bringing a memory to mind so that it can be reinterpreted, the impact of memory reactivation on cognitive reappraisal has not been well studied. I will use fMRI to investigate this gap in the literature, using data from a study for which data collection is already underway in the Ritchey Lab. Finally, in Study 3, I will use the eye tracker to study whether the application of temporally targeted visual stimuli can be used to modify subsequent memory performance by modulating memory reactivation strength. Prior research has demonstrated the relevance of using eye-tracking, which has finer temporal resolution and is more accessible than fMRI, to examine memory reactivation. Put together, this work will provide more insight into how memory reactivation strength influences the fate of negative memories, specifically after engaging in memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal. It will also elucidate ways in which memory reactivation can be leveraged and optimized in different coping strategies for dealing with unwanted, negative memories. The expertise of my sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborator will be pivotal to my development as a researcher and the success of my dissertation work. In the K00 Phase, I will expand my knowledge of mental health disorders so that I can be equipped to become an independent researcher at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health disorders. Project Narrative  For my dissertation, I will investigate inter-subject and inter-trial differences in memory reactivation strength and how this variability affects memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal efficacy. This work will help to identify ways in which memory reactivation can be optimally leveraged to help people cope with negative, unwanted memories. Specifically, this work might provide ways to personalize interventions for patients with mental health disorders, such as depression, to increase the therapeutic impact.",The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation,10155909,F99NS120647,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cues ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Prize ', ' falls ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Development Plans ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' career development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' coping ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' emotional stimulus ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,NJ-12,-0.005775120110258664
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Emotions ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Human Volunteers ', ' In Vitro ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Personhood ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Collection ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' decision research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' brain machine interface ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' volunteer ', ' brain research ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard measure ', ' neuroethics ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' optogenetics ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,CA-18,0.018729856003837107
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9883842,R01MH119430,"['absorption ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eyebrow structure ', ' Eyebrows ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Oxyhemoglobin ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smiling ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' emotional reaction ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' mimicry ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Head Movements ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' magnetic field ', ' dyadic interaction ', ' contagion ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' facial processing ', ' Face Processing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' neural correlate ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,400249,CT-03,0.02963625496409877
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,9883647,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' age group ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' movie ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' face perception ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' social neuroscience ', ' positive mood ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' early adolescence ', ' Social Processes ', ' graph theory ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,675503,MD-05,0.06591842681458271
"Combinatorial matrix-mimetic recombinant proteins as engineered nerve guidance conduits ABSTRACT Over 500,000 Americans suffer from peripheral nerve injury (PNI), and despite surgical interventions, most suffer permanent loss of motor function and sensation. Current clinical options for long nerve gap PNI include naturally- derived grafts, which provide native matrix cues to regenerate neurons but suffer from very limited supply and batch-to-batch variability, or synthetic nerve guidance conduits (NGCs), which are easy to manufacture but often fail due to lack of regenerative cues. The main challenge with using any NGC for treatment of PNI is the immense trade-off between providing the complex matrix cues necessary for optimal nerve regeneration while providing a conduit that is readily available, reproducible, and easily fabricated. To overcome this challenge, we propose an entirely new type of biomaterial: a computationally optimized, protein-engineered recombinant NGC (rNGC). This rNGC combines the reliability of synthetic NGCs with the presentation of multiple regenerative matrix cues of natural NGCs. Because current understanding of cell-matrix interactions is insufficient to enable to direct design of a fully functional rNGC, we hypothesize that the use of machine learning, computational optimization methods will allow identification of an rNGC that promotes nerve regeneration similar to the current gold standard autograft. We utilize a family of protein-engineered, elastin-like proteins (ELPs) that are reproducible, with predictable, consistent material properties, and fully chemically defined for streamlined FDA approval. Due to ELPs’ modular design, they have biomechanical (i.e. matrix stiffness) and biochemical (i.e. cell-adhesive ligand) properties that are independently tunable over a broad range. While numerous studies detail the effects of individual biomechanical or biochemical matrix cues on neurite outgrowth using single-variable approaches, their combinatorial effects have been largely unexplored as insufficient knowledge exists to make accurate predictions of their interactions a priori. This fundamentally prohibits the direct design of combinatorial matrix cues. We hypothesize that optimized presentation of biomechanical and biochemical cues will create a microenvironment that better mimics the native ECM milieu, resulting in synergistic ligand cross-talk to improve nerve regeneration. In Aim 1, we use computational optimization methods to identify the combination of ligand identities, ligand concentrations, and matrix stiffness that best enhances neurite outgrowth. We will develop and characterize a library of ELP variants with distinct cell-adhesive ligands derived from native ECM, and assess their ability to support neurite outgrowth from rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In Aim 2, we will validate our in vitro optimization results in a preclinical, rat sciatic nerve injury model. A core-shell, ELP-based rNGC with an inner core matrix of the optimized ELP formulation from Aim 1 will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to enhance therapeutic outcome. Controls include reversed nerve autograft, hollow silicone conduit, and non-optimized ELP- based rNGC. This study would represent the first use of computational optimization methods to design a reproducible, reliable, recombinant biomaterial with multiple regenerative matrix cues. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main challenge with using nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) to bridge long peripheral nerve gap injuries is the immense trade-off between providing the complex matrix cues necessary for optimal nerve regeneration while providing a conduit that is readily available, reproducible, and easily fabricated. To address this challenge, here we utilize (1) computational optimization methods to identify the optimal biochemical and biomechanical matrix cues for nerve regeneration, and (2) advanced protein-engineering strategies to incorporate these cues into a recombinant NGC (rNGC).

"Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional) R&R Other Project Information 7. Project Summary/Abstract Neurobiological changes caused by addiction impair behavioral control and increase relapse risk (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016), substantiating the need for long-term care coordination and recovery engagement for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) (Humphreys, Malenka, Knutson, & MacCoun, 2017). Because addiction creates stress and reward system dysregulation impairing emotional regulation and executive functioning capacities when experiencing intense craving (Volkow, Koob & McLellan, 2016), traditional didactic relapse prevention strategies may have limited efficacy for those in early recovery when they transition back to their natural communities’ post-discharge from treatment, where they will be exposed to SUD-related stimuli. New recovery support models that detect implicit cue-induced neurophysiological dysregulation and restore real-time regulatory capacity to decrease relapse risk are of clinical significance. ​This feasibility Phase I study will use Virtual Reality (VR) technology to 1) simulate a patient-specific drug cue-triggering experience (VR_drug) to calibrate a personalized neurophysiological relapse risk set-point, captured in-session using fNIRS (​Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy​) sensors, a portable alternative to fMRI which will be integrated into the VR HMD (Head Mounted Display),​ and physiological sensors (smartwatch Empatica E4) worn during the VR_drug scenario ​(Aim 1); ​and 2) simulate a recovery-regulation experience (VR_recovery) using patient-specific virtually-generated sober-supportive relationships, recovery-enhanced environmental conditions, and recovery-associated sensory cues, to calibrate a recovery-regulated neurophysiological set-point, captured by the same in-session neurophysiological sensors systems ​(Aim 2)​. If successful, in Phase II, a mobile recovery support system product will be developed to help individuals in SUD recovery modulate real-time craving by monitoring their personalized neurophysiological relapse risk and activating their recovery-regulation intervention (VR_recovery) to alter urge reactivity in real-time. This type of mobile intervention that is immediately available to individuals in recovery as they leave treatment institutions and transition back into their natural communities may help manage in-the-moment drug urges in ways that allow engagement in other recovery-related activities (e.g., calling a sponsor, getting to a meeting), decreasing real-time relapse risk (Matto,& Seshaiyer, 2018; Matto, 2015; Matto, et al, 2014). R&R Other Project Information 8. Project Narrative Addiction is a self-regulation disorder where chronic exposure to and compulsive consumption of the drug creates dysregulation in the reward, stress and executive functioning regions of the brain, intensifying emotional reactivity and impairing cognitive and behavioral control (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016). This study seeks to examine the utility of using Virtual Reality (VR) simulations to calibrate person-specific neurophysiological relapse-risk and recovery regulation set-points. Results may lead to the development of a non-pharmacological mobile recovery support system to help individuals in SUD recovery manage implicit craving reactivity in ways that reduce relapse risk.",Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional),9898050,R41DA050225,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cocaine ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Euphoria ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Stimulus ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' implicit memory ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' cue reactivity ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' virtual reality ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' Institution ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' virtual ', ' conditioning ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' prototype ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' patient profile ', ' profiles in patients ', ' relapse risk ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' virtual simulation ', ' virtual reality simulation ', ' head mounted device ', ' head mounted display ', ' ']",NIDA,"BRIGHTLINE INTERACTIVE, LLC",R41,2020,218097,VA-08,-0.013957205630505112
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9990732,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' coping ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,623237,MI-12,0.024872898913171477
