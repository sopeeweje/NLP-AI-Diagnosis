"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.           Project Narrative The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          ",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['histone modification ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Saccharomycetales ', ' Endomycetales ', ' Budding Yeast ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Galactose ', ' Galactopyranoside ', ' Galactopyranose ', ' D-Galactose ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heart ', ' Alanine ', ' L-Isomer Alanine ', ' L-Alanine ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Histones ', ' Algorithms ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mycophenolic Acid ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems.

We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          ",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['N-terminal ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' Saccharomycetales ', ' Endomycetales ', ' Budding Yeast ', ' Tyrosine ', ' para-Tyrosine ', ' L-isomer Tyrosine ', ' L-Tyrosine ', ' histone modification ', ' Chromosomes ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Metric ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Isomer Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Chromatin ', ' Length ', ' protein function ', ' Resolution ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' member ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Measurement ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Defect ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Technology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Heart ', ' Reporting ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Individual ', ' Goals ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Maps ', ' Modification ', ' Scanning ', ' Work ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' insight ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Generations ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Pattern ', ' Biological ', ' mutant ', ' Genes ', ' in vivo ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Regulation ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Play ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Address ', ' Complex ', ' gene function ', ' Data ', ' Biology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Methods ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Alanine ', ' L-Isomer Alanine ', ' L-Alanine ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Essential Genes ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2 ', ' Chromosome 2 ', ' Glutamic Acid ', ' L-Glutamic Acid ', ' Galactose ', ' Galactopyranoside ', ' Galactopyranose ', ' D-Galactose ', ' Aspartic Acid ', ' L-Aspartic Acid ', ' genetic profiling ', ' Mycophenolic Acid ', ' Serine ', ' L-Serine ', ' Histones ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Histone H4 ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Tail ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems.

We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition. Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.",Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome,8309335,F32GM095273,"['Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biology ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Fertilizers ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Q.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells.

"An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites.

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8463019,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' DNase ', ' DNA Nucleases ', ' Deoxyribonucleases ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Histones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Reading ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' bisulfite ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Lasso ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' preference ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' epigenomics ', ' data modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combinatorial ', ' sequence learning ', ' mouse genome ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Chip sequencing ', ' Chip seq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2013,493524,NY-12,0.163012066379016

"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.            ",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8815597,R01ES024992,"['Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Display ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Parasites ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trees ', ' Enhancers ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,189100,MO-01,0.08294293433733789
"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease.

"An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD).

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3).

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off.

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8862371,R01AI106775,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Drug Design ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Parasite Control ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virulence ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Virulent ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant to Parasite ', ' resistance to Parasite ', ' parasite resistant ', ' Parasite resistance ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' combat ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,451989,WA-07,0.06701757877567474
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.

"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.              ",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),8749475,K22AI112570,"['Affect ', ' Inflammatory Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-Cells ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' genetic enhancer element ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' Enhancer Elements (Genetics) ', ' Europe ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North America ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Enhancers ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Histone Acetylation ', ' NCAM1 ', ' NCAM ', ' CD56 ', ' NCAM1 gene ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' CD14 ', ' CD14 gene ', ' CD19 ', ' CD19 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' commensal bacteria ', ' commensal microbes ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' markov model ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Microbe ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2015,161200,PA-03,0.02098427481938969
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems.

We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8928618,R01ES024992,"['Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Display ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Parasites ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trees ', ' Enhancers ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,152500,MO-01,0.08294293433733789
"ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.            ",ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER,8888066,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' EC 2.7.7.6 ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' Specificity ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' empowered ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cell engineering ', ' cellular engineering ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' public health relevance ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397299,MO-01,0.07410108092325654

In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories.

"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs.

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9157021,R01GM120167,"['Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Genetics ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' pluripotency ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' human genomics ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404036,MD-07,0.17728478267497963
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders.

"Deep learning frameworks for regulatory genomics. PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of genome sequencing and functional genomic data in multiple cellular contexts across healthy and diseased individuals provides a unique opportunity to decipher the regulatory and genetic architecture of diseases and traits. Novel computational methods are required that can address fundamental problems involving data representation, data integration, learning accurate predictive models from large-scale datasets and extraction of novel biological insights from complex models. We propose novel machine learning frameworks based on deep neural networks with new interpretation and hypothesis generation engines capable of integrating a wide variety of key genomic data types to learn predictive models of chromatin architecture and chromatin state; integrative models of transcription factor binding; determinants of macroscale three-dimensional genome architecture involving long-range chromatin contacts and the regulatory basis of functional non-coding, regulatory variants. Our methods are highly generalizable to several other related problems in regulatory genomics and lay the foundation for a paradigm shift in computational genomics.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.            ",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9106490,R01GM051946,"['Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Logic ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Repression ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Homeotic Proteins ', ' Homeoproteins ', ' Homeodomain Family Protein ', ' Homeobox Proteins ', ' Homeobox Family Protein ', ' Homeo Domain Proteins ', ' Homeodomain Proteins ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Transact ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Gene Order ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Pattern Formation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' morphogens ', ' public health relevance ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,360706,NY-12,0.05994938493259499
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer.

"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).

"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.",Super-enhancer structure

"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,9067925,R01AI106775,"['Accounting

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic signature ', ' immune health ', ' immune system health ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,ME-02,0.08714712035720162
"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9276695,R01GM051946,"['Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Logic ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Repression ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' GBF protein ', ' GBF bZIP protein ', ' bZIP Protein ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Homeotic Proteins ', ' Homeoproteins ', ' Homeodomain Family Protein ', ' Homeobox Proteins ', ' Homeobox Family Protein ', ' Homeo Domain Proteins ', ' Homeodomain Proteins ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Transact ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' Pattern Formation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' morphogens ', ' public health relevance ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,356861,NY-12,0.05994938493259499
"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9253408,R01GM113708,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' experience ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' ward ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Collection ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' comparison group ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' epigenome ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Genetic study ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,284959,MA-07,0.1342399941900418
"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes. In turn, this improved understanding will bring forth new potential targets to approach incorrect regulation leading to disease.",Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements,9478475,R00HG007356,"['Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Elements ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' Genetic Enhancer Element ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Transactivators ', ' Trans-Acting Factors ', ' Trans-Activators ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transfection ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' LIF gene ', ' leukemia inhibitory factor ', ' leukemia inhibitor factor ', ' LIF ', ' D-Factor ', ' Cholinergic Differentiation Factor ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' combinatorial ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' online course ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R00,2017,50000,MI-12,0.14003792177762245
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9247640,UM1HG009435,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' HepG2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2017,654000,MA-07,0.11013594539026164
"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9306648,R01HG009136,"['Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' data modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Computers ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,596615,WA-07,0.08473424599536715
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).

We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2).

"Administrative Supplement: Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders. Our work will provide new insight into the identity, composition and biological requirement for these gene switches, informing our understanding of mutations that contribute to common genetic

"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9368022,R01HG009674,"['Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' v-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Cellular Homolog ', ' cmyc ', ' c myc ', ' c-myc Genes ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' heterokaryon ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' novel ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Modeling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' functional genomics ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Genomics ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Cell fusion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cell Fate Control ', ' Cell Fate Regulation ', ' Transcription Factor 3 ', ' Transcription Factor E2-Alpha ', ' Kappa-E2-Binding Factor ', ' Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 1 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E47 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E12 ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' nuclear reprogramming ', ' epigenomics ', ' feeding ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' combinatorial ', ' loss of function ', ' pluripotency ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ', ' epigenome ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,694416,CA-18,0.17064588846866788
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics.

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9356566,R01GM120167,"['Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' pluripotency ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' human genomics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,463781,MD-07,0.17728478267497963
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

(1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses. It will thus provide an essential foundation for the immunogenic understanding of immune responses in health and disease.",ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells,9358071,R24AI072073,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Boston ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Maps ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Washington ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' Enhancers ', ' Lymphoid Cell ', ' Immunology ', ' Guidelines ', ' Intuition ', ' Data Quality ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' cell type ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' immunogenic ', ' Myeloid Cells ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Structures ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Population ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' stem ', ' immune activation ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' cloud based ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptome ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' data access ', ' ']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R24,2017,1727457,MA-07,0.12245045800919177
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9280975,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' Specificity ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cellular engineering ', ' cell engineering ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' public health relevance ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' synthetic genomics ', ' chromosomal location ', ' chromosome location ', ' chromosomal position ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,397299,MO-01,0.07410108092325654
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer.

"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9431485,K99HG009920,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Separation ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Faculty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Activities ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Persons ', ' Plasmids ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Region ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' biochemical model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' lupus-like ', ' Secure ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' genetic predictors ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' human genomics ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,120204,MA-07,0.059559412974006784
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9475243,R01HG009136,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dwarfism ', ' Nanism ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,590281,WA-07,0.08473424599536715
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9578803,R01GM129126,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Histones ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Repression ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Writing ', ' Yeasts ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predicting response ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,311500,MO-01,0.09809345205936618
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9542357,R01HG009674,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' c-myc Genes ', ' v-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Cellular Homolog ', ' cmyc ', ' c myc ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' heterokaryon ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' novel ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Modeling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' functional genomics ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Genomics ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Cell fusion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cell Fate Control ', ' Cell Fate Regulation ', ' Transcription Factor 3 ', ' Transcription Factor E2-Alpha ', ' Kappa-E2-Binding Factor ', ' Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 1 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E47 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E12 ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' nuclear reprogramming ', ' epigenomics ', ' feeding ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' combinatorial ', ' loss of function ', ' pluripotency ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ', ' epigenome ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' transcriptome ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,702694,CA-18,0.17064588846866788

"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9509167,R21HG010070,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmids ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Measures ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Point Mutation ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Allelic Imbalance ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' human disease ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' Transcription Factor 14, Hepatic Nuclear Factor ', ' TCF14 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor, 4 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-Alpha ', ' HNF4A ', ' HNF4-Alpha ', ' HNF4 ', ' HNF4A gene ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,196302,CA-52,0.010646512379696719
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs.

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9564177,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2018,500000,MA-07,0.11013594539026164
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders. Our work will provide new insight into the identity, composition and biological requirement for these gene switches, informing our understanding of mutations that contribute to common genetic disorders.",Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon,9511921,R01NS062972,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Genes ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Congenital Megacolon ', ' pelvirectal achalasia ', ' aganglionosis ', ' Hirschsprung Disease ', ' Aganglionic Megacolon ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' hindbrain ', ' Rhombencephalon ', ' Hind Brain ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Satiation ', ' satiety ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase ', ' Tyrosine Hydroxylase ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Forebrain ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' Ortholog ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Mutate ', ' Ontology ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Instruction ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' encryption ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' 4C-seq ', ' Chromatin Conformation Capture and Sequencing ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,461240,MD-07,0.1364755390762234
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9500095,R01HG010045,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Chromatin ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ice ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' cell type ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' markov model ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' epigenome ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,411292,WI-02,0.15465418814644324
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9576241,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' graph theory ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2018,449829,CA-52,0.07632950740151098
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Project Narrative Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Orofacial clefting is a common disease that causes significant morbidity for the affected individual and a major burden to families and society. The etiology of orofacial clefting is complex, but genetic factors contribute significant risk. To date, scores of genes have been identified where rare variants cause rare syndromic forms of orofacial clefting, and DNA variants at 24 loci have been associated with the common non-syndromic form of orofacial clefting. Despite these efforts, less than half of the heritable risk has been identified. In addition, the pathogenic variant has yet to be determined at most of the 24 associated loci. New approaches are needed to identify these genetic risk factors. Since most of the associated loci are located between genes, it is hypothesized that the pathogenic allele is in a regulatory element. Thus, the new approaches should not only help find new candidate genes but they should also find the elements that regulate the expression of those genes. In this proposal, we will use a triumvirate approach to find new candidate genes, the DNA elements that regulate their expression and the transcription factors that bind to those regulatory elements. In total, analysis of these three datasets will yield a gene regulatory network for a target tissue. The target tissue for this proposal is periderm. Periderm is the most superficial layer of squamous epithelial cells that covers the entire embryo, including the oral cavity. Recent studies from human and animal models identified 19 genes that are essential for periderm development, and of these, 10 have DNA variation that causes or increases risk for orofacial clefting. Despite its significant role in palate development, little is known about periderm at the molecular level. The immediate goals of this proposal are to i) determine the gene regulatory network for periderm and ii) apply that new knowledge to identify alleles within the 24 associated loci that perturb the gene regulatory network for periderm. The longterm goals of this proposal are to identify genetic pathways that are essential for periderm differentiation and to identify the actual pathogenic DNA variants that perturb these pathways. This new knowledge will help determine recurrence risk and provide opportunities to develop new rational therapies. In particular, since periderm only exists in the embryo and since it is the most superficial layer of the embryo, it is an ideal target for in utero therapies, when and where orofacial clefting actually occurs. We have two parallel specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm differentiation in zebrafish by systematically perturbing the system. In Aim 2, we will use a parallel approach to determine the gene regulatory network for mouse periderm. It is essential to use both animal models because while studies of zebrafish periderm led to the identification of genes required for development of the lip and palate, the “periderm” between these two clades has a different embryonic origin and it is possible aspects of the gene regulatory network are different. Our project thus exploits the power and tractability of the zebrafish, and the human-like origin of periderm in the mouse. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9783225,R56DE023575,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Separation ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Epidermis ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Transposase ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Palate ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' RNA analysis ', ' prenatal therapy ', ' in utero therapy ', ' fetus therapy ', ' Fetal Therapies ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutation ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutant ', ' Dominant Negative ', ' Antimorphic mutation ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oral epithelium ', ' oral epithelia ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' paralog ', ' paralogous gene ', ' vector ', ' orofacial ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' rare syndrome ', ' rare condition ', ' human model ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R56,2018,339622,IA-02,0.09352791685904384
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9536926,R35GM124922,"['Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' immune system health ', ' immune health ', ' NGS data ', ' next generation sequence data ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2018,448757,ME-02,0.08714712035720162
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9696513,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2018,933353,MA-07,0.11013594539026164
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9490337,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' Specificity ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cellular engineering ', ' cell engineering ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' public health relevance ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' synthetic genomics ', ' chromosome location ', ' chromosomal position ', ' chromosomal location ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,397299,MO-01,0.07410108092325654
"2/2-Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers associated with the development of psychiatric disorders In this project, we will develop novel methods for finding brain-specific enhancers, build regulatory networks, deconvolve brain-region-specific regulation, and relate differential enhancer signals to variations in the human population.

We will then validate these predicted regulatory elements using large-scale genomic assays in neuroblastoma cells, iPSC cells, and neuronal precursor cells differentiated into neuronal lineages, and using a microfluidics platform capable of culturing neuronal cells and neuronal organoids. The results from these studies will further our understanding of the genetic regulatory basis for neuronal function in both normal and neuropsychiatric disease states.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Deoxyribonuclease I ', ' Thymonuclease ', ' Pancreatic DNase ', ' DNase I ', ' DNA Endonuclease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' ds-DNA ', ' dsDNA ', ' Double-Stranded DNA ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' cell type ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ', ' gel shift assay ', ' Mobility Shift Assay ', ' Bandshift Mobility Assay ', ' Band Shift Mobility Assay ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Modification Process ', ' DNA Modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' DNase-I Footprinting ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Transcript ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' malignant stem cell ', ' cancer stem cell ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' pluripotency ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,MA-07,0.1506468799780768
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium.

"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9761568,R21HG010070,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmids ', ' Proteins ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Point Mutation ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Allelic Imbalance ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' human disease ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' HepG2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HNF4A gene ', ' Transcription Factor 14, Hepatic Nuclear Factor ', ' TCF14 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor, 4 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-Alpha ', ' HNF4A ', ' HNF4-Alpha ', ' HNF4 ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,236250,CA-52,0.010646512379696719

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs.

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",9699641,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' gene interaction ', ' synergism ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' transcriptomics ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' neurogenomics ', ' neuro-genomics ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2019,356979,IL-13,0.10361652355784727
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists.

"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,9711034,R01HG010478,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Larva ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' roundworm ', ' Nematodes ', ' Nematoda ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transposase ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' muscle system ', ' muscular system ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Population ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,510309,WA-07,0.10168740909045115
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9738125,R01DE023575,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Epidermis ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Nasal cavity ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' CDH1 gene ', ' LCAM ', ' CDHE ', ' CDH1 ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Palate ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Embryo Loss ', ' embryonic loss ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Genetics ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' oral epithelium ', ' oral epithelia ', ' paralogous gene ', ' paralog ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' orofacial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' model building ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,225980,IA-02,0.031092693737885202
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation.

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages.

"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics.

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases.

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer.

Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms.

"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9722284,R01HG009674,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cell

"Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have given us many clues about the mutations that cause common genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, many of the mutations implicated in disease lie outside of the genes themselves and instead lie in the regions controlling expression of the genes, and so probably contribute to disease by producing the wrong amount of the gene in the wrong tissue or at the wrong time. Mutations in regulatory regions are thought to cause disease by altering the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA, changing the DNA sequence from one that the protein can bind to one that it cannot (or vice versa). However, the ways in which these regulatory proteins control gene expression remains incompletely understood and so it is presently difficult to understand which regulatory protein binds differently to a mutated regulatory region, or how that change in binding affects expression of the regulated genes. In fact, we still do not even know where the regulatory regions are in the tissues we think are dysfunctional in disease. This project aims to better understand how these mutations contribute to autoimmune disease by first increasing our understanding of how regulatory proteins and regulatory regions work to control when and where genes are expressed, and then applying this knowledge to understand genetic disease. First, regulatory regions will be identified in immune cells and their effects on gene expression measured so that mutations that are likely to contribute to disease (those in regulatory regions) can be identified. The relationship between regulatory proteins, regulatory sequence, and gene expression will be learned by creating millions of synthetic regulatory regions and measuring their effect on gene expression, providing many examples of binding sites for each regulatory protein from which to learn. Finally, our new understanding of gene regulation will be applied to determine which genetic mutations change regulatory protein binding and cause disease. This will help us better understand the underlying causes of disease so that new treatments can be developed that target the mutations within each person. The candidate's long term career goals are to better understand how gene regulation works in humans so that we can better understand how the sequence of the genome controls the expression of our genes. The candidate currently works at the Broad Institute, a leading institute in human genetics and genomics with the resources and personnel required of this project. In order to continue to develop as a scientist, the candidate will gain more experience teaching, publish and present his existing findings, gain the necessary skills to work with human cells, and secure a faculty position and funding so that he can continue to make a positive impact on our knowledge of the genome. Project Narrative Certain genetic diseases are thought to be caused by mutations in the DNA that alter the expression of nearby genes. This project will help us to understand how DNA sequence regulates the expression of genes, and aims to apply this knowledge to predict how and why mutations change gene expression and contribute to disease. By better understanding the fundamental causes of disease, we can better design therapeutic interventions.",Learning the rules of enhancer activity to understand non-coding genetic variation in autoimmune disease,9695242,K99HG009920,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Faculty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Activities ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Persons ', ' Plasmids ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Region ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' biochemical model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Lupus ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' Secure ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' genetic predictors ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' human genomics ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,90935,MA-07,0.059559412974006784
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9623355,R01HG009906,"['cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Intuition ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' high throughput technology ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' chromatin modifier ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Genome engineering ', ' Coupled ', ' mammalian genome ', ' prototype ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' genome annotation ', ' epigenome ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' genome browser ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,284020,PA-10,0.12280417778740403
"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9637415,R01HG009136,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Computers ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Nanism ', ' Dwarfism ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Nucleotides ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' causal variant ', ' causative variant ', ' causative mutation ', ' causal mutation ', ' causal gene ', ' causal allele ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,582191,WA-07,0.08473424599536715
"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9667439,R01GM051946,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Animals ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Logic ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Repression ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' bZIP Protein ', ' GBF protein ', ' GBF bZIP protein ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Homeodomain Proteins ', ' Homeotic Proteins ', ' Homeoproteins ', ' Homeodomain Family Protein ', ' Homeobox Proteins ', ' Homeobox Family Protein ', ' Homeo Domain Proteins ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Transact ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' Pattern Formation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' morphogens ', ' public health relevance ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362238,NY-12,0.05994938493259499
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9751340,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Population ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' graph theory ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2019,449829,CA-52,0.07632950740151098
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9789336,R01GM129126,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Chromatin ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Histones ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Proteins ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Repression ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Writing ', ' Yeasts ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314166,MO-01,0.09809345205936618
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium.

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10039384,K01MH123896,"['genomic

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9894822,R01HG009892,"['synthetic DNA ', ' synthetic construct ', ' computer science ', "" 5'UTR "", ' mRNA Leader Sequences ', "" 5' Untranslated Regions "", "" 3'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' RNA Stability ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' DNA bank ', ' DNA Library ', ' Genomics ', ' voice recognition ', ' protein expression ', ' mRNA Stability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Expression Library ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' comparative ', ' screening ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' polysome profiling ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' machine vision ', ' statistical learning ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Engineering ', ' Human Genetics ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Polyribosomes ', ' Polysomes ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thiouridine ', ' 4-Thiouridine ', ' 4-thio-uridine ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' stable cell line ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,473065,WA-07,0.02761906686576086
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' immune system health ', ' immune health ', ' NGS data ', ' next generation sequence data ', ' informatics tool ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,ME-02,0.08714712035720162
"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,10001077,R01HG010889,"['Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transposase ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' rapid growth ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' single cell technology ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple data types ', ' ']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,409375,MD-07,0.06350067829921809
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9980439,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' genes structure ', ' Gene Structure ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' graph theory ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2020,449649,CA-52,0.07632950740151098
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) Predictive Models of Boundaries of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) in Human. The PI proposes a high-impact research project to develop novel predictive models to predict boundaries of topologically associated domains in a variety of human cell lines. The goal of this proposal is not just building these models, but to interpret them to decipher some biological meaning. Studies have recently indicated that genomes of different organisms are organized into domains called topologically associated domains (TADs), which consist of self-interacting chromatin regions. The boundaries of TADs have been linked to several diseases and gene regulation by modulating the overall genome organization. Accurate identification of these boundaries and interpretation of regulatory units in the boundaries are essential for development of effective therapy for diseases in future. Since existing experimental methods are costly and challenging, we will explore, evaluate, and compare predictive models for accurate prediction of TAD boundaries in different cell lines. We propose to test if sequence and chromatin features can be used in traditional feature based predictive models for TADs boundaries. This will be compared to deep learning models which have the capacity to “learn” important discriminative features from sequence information only. By interpreting these models, we will characterize the regulatory code of TAD boundaries by (a) characterizing a comprehensive list of motifs in TAD boundaries in 10 different human cell lines, (b) characterizing the association between different chromatin features and their predicting power of the boundaries, and (c) scoring, ranking and prioritizing likely causal noncoding variants that occur in TAD boundaries. Furthermore, this proposal will enhance the infrastructure of research and education at University of Houston-Downtown, introducing computational biology research experiences to underrepresented minority, first time in college and female undergraduate students, who would otherwise lack such opportunities. This will allow them to acquire a broad area of skills in data analytics, critical thinking, and research methods, which will encourage them to pursue a biomedical career and change their lives and communities. Understanding genome organization is essential for deciphering the complex mechanisms associated with gene regulation and development of effective therapies for diseases. To address current experimental challenges to quantify genome organization, we propose to develop novel artificial intelligence predictive methods to decipher genome organization in humans. These methods will also help link how genome organization modulates gene expression and how it can contribute to diseases.",Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs),9965292,R15GM137254,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Universities ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' hESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Consumption ', ' mammalian genome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' model building ', ' Data Analytics ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' deep learning ', ' long short term memory ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON-DOWNTOWN,R15,2020,399888,TX-18,0.08615796080506723
"Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens ABSTRACT  Enhancers are essential regulatory elements that together with transcription factors (TFs) instruct cell- type specific transcriptional programs during development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Initiatives such as the ENCODE project, revealed tens of thousands putative enhancers based on linear proximity, using criteria like chromatin accessibility, TF binding, and histone modifications such as H3K27ac. However, a main challenge of uncovering functional enhancers and assigning them to target genes lies in the complexity of the 3D chromatin organization, which can influence enhancer specificity and activity. Using an advanced chromosome conformation capture assay, we recently captured the dynamic rewiring of 3D enhancer networks during mouse somatic cell reprogramming and discovered multi-connected enhancers that we named “3D enhancer hubs”. Here we extend the 3D mapping approach to human primary islets, and compare islets from healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors to assemble a 4D atlas to capture the rewiring of 3D enhancer network in disease progression. At the same time, we plan to compare the enhancer network in adult islets to earlier stages of development by using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate early β cells and their developmental precursors. Utilizing these 4D genomic data, we will computationally nominate core β-cell specific enhancers relevant to β cell development, function, and T2D, and then interrogate these putative enhancers through large-scale CRISPRi mediated perturbation screens using hPSC-β cells. Enhancers identified from the screening effort will be further validated in an established human β cell line and primary human islet β cells. This proposal addresses a critical gap in the 4DN initiative, that is how to translate 3D genomics data into functional data with respect to gene expression in the context of human health. Successful completion of our aims will establish a paradigm for the discovery and interrogation of functional enhancers that instruct transcriptional programs specific to a cell type of interest, reveal unique insights into their mechanisms of action, and identify enhancers with relevance to human development and disease. For instance, uncovering functional enhancers could assist the identification of noncoding causal variants identified in genome-wide association studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will take an integrative approach involving generating a 4D atlas of regulatory interactions during both development and disease progressions, computationally nominating diabetes-relevant β cell enhancers through integrative analysis and discovering functional enhancers through large-scale perturbation screens. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks that instruct the β cell fate and function during development and in diabetic conditions.","Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens",10117708,U01DK128852,"['Adult ', ' 21+

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression.

"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages.

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10021007,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' gene interaction ', ' synergism ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' transcriptomics ', ' biophysical model ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' neuro-genomics ', ' neurogenomics ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2020,356979,IL-13,0.10361652355784727
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9952404,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' HepG2 ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2020,1496387,MA-07,0.11013594539026164
"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects.

"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. One of the main bottlenecks in analysis of genomic data is efficient and scalable visualization approaches. The PEGR open source platform will provide programmatic access to any number of human cell sequenced datasets, from any stage of NGS processing, with the pipeline analysis results available for high-throughput machine learning testing and development. This project will empower discovery through the automated analysis and visualization of results from both small- and large-scale datasets. This architecture will include the following features: 1) a secure, cloud-based, metadata management system that instills best practices of experimental rigor, reproducibility, and data sharing; 2) automated Galaxy-based epigenomic data processing pipelines that provide easy-to-use “wizards” for standardized processing of common epigenomic data types; and 3) an easily de-ployable, open source software package as a means to disseminate data, tools, and discoveries via cloud services. Project Narrative Proteins that bind to the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of their positional organization informs us of how cells normally behave, and how they will respond to stress, disease, and therapies.

"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,9969245,R01HG010478,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Larva ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Transposase ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' muscle system ', ' muscular system ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Population ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,510309,WA-07,0.10168740909045115
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions.

"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,9891599,R03DE028588,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chromatin ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Exons ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligation ', ' Closure by Ligation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Body part ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' craniofacial anomalies ', ' craniofacial defects ', ' craniofacial malformation ', ' Craniofacial Abnormalities ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Live Birth ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' gene interaction ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Neural Crest Cell ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TWIST 1 ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TWIST1 ', ' TWIST gene ', ' TWIST1 ', ' Transcription Factor TWIST ', ' twist protein ', ' TWIST1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' orofacial ', ' virtual ', ' Coupled ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' comparative ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' FaceBase ', ' genetic information ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' computational pipelines ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2020,164000,CT-05,0.12716607296635257
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC.

"Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development Abstract The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges. To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG) progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined. The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain. Narrative The project seeks to gain a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks within cells that control the generation of key progenitor cell types that arise during human brain development. To do so, it will develop modeling and computational tools as well as test these tools on human embryonic stem cell lines. In the longer term, a quantitative understanding of the circuits within cells that control development will allow us to uncover mechanisms underlying developmental disease.",Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development,9968562,R01HD100036,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Lentils -

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9869019,R01HG009136,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dwarfism ', ' Nanism ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' synthetic construct ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' causal variant ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,573285,WA-07,0.08473424599536715
