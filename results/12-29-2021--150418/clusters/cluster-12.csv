"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials. This will be accomplished by a multi-disciplinary team who will use their expertise in nanomaterial science, biology, toxicology, imaging, statistics and computer science to integrate above goals into a predictive model that projects from what is happening in cells to what may happen in the lung.",Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology,8016739,U19ES019528,[''],NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U19,2010,1144284,CA-33,0.12986397501092925
"High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility genes for lung cancer using a systematic genome- wide association-based approach. To achieve this goal, we are applying a two-stage design. This proposal builds upon an extensive resource of lung cancer cases and controls matched for smoking behavior, sex, and ethnicity who have been collected over many years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and on a recently approved proposal to the Center for Inherited Disease Research that is performing genotyping of 317,000 markers on 1200 Caucasian ever-smoking lung cancer cases and 1200 controls matched for ethnicity, age, smoking behavior, and sex. Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk. Cases and controls have extensive epidemiological and family history data together with candidate gene and functional DNA repair measures. The end result of our analysis will substantively increase our understanding of the genetic etiology of lung cancer and gene-environment interactions that contribute to its causation. This is an experienced investigative team, using state of the art technology to perform a multistage genome-wide analysis on a large, uniquely well-characterized population of lung cancer cases and matched controls with rich functional data. We are collaborating with the International Lung Cancer Consortium so that it can further validate our findings for a variety of different populations, in future initiatives.                                                              ",High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer,7858483,R01CA121197,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dietary intake ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Genotypic Risk Ratio ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking History ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Smoking Status ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Algorithms ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Fostering ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Sample Size ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Family Cancer History ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Persons ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Smoke ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Tobacco ', ' Caucasians ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene interaction ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC -

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.              ",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),7867527,U01HL101456,"['Cysteine ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' Data Collection ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Alveolar ', ' Environment ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Stratification ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Malnutrition ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Free Radicals ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Library ', ' genetic library ', ' Genes ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Age ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Homocysteine ', ' L-Isomer Homocysteine ', ' 2-amino-4-mercaptobutyric acid ', ' Homocystine ', "" Butanoic acid, 4,4'-dithiobis(2-amino)- "", ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Hepatic ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Infant Health ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Survivors ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Methionine ', ' L-Methionine ', ' L-Isomer Methionine ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity -

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,7746494,R01CA127219,"['Publishing ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Respiratory System ', ' respiratory tract ', ' Respiratory system (all sites) ', ' Pulmonary Organ System ', ' Pulmonary Body System ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Smoking ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Asbestos ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Adopted ', ' Caucasians ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Host Defense ', ' Nucleotide Excision Repair ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' gene interaction ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC -

"Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Many radiotherapy (RT) treatments carry a significant risk of serious complications to normal tissues. Previously, efforts to predict outcome have used either physical factors (e.g., volume irradiated to high dose) or biological factors (e.g., inherent radiosensitivity), but not both. We hypothesize that combining physical treatment data with patient-specific biomarkers will increase the predictive power of RT outcomes models. We will test this hypothesis specifically for prediction of radiation pneumonitis (RP) for lung cancer patients. Because no appropriate dataset exists to test this hypothesis, under Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective clinical trial for non-small-cell lung cancer patients and collect candidate physical and biological data for modeling. Biomarker families selected based on peer-reviewed literature will mainly include:  (a) the levels of DNA-end binding complexes of DNA damage detection and repair proteins, which has been well correlated with radiosensitivity; and (b) pretreatment blood levels of the interleukin family of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha and IL-6) and ACE enzymes, which have also been correlated to RP. Physical data to be collected includes volumes irradiated to varying doses of the normal lung (dose-volume histogram data, collected using 4-D methods to avoid breathing artifacts), and the spatial location of the high-dose regions, both of which have been correlated with risk of RP. We will also image tumor regression over the course of RT (mid-course and at the end of RT) in order to better characterize the high doses received by normal lung tissue after tumor regression. In SA2, we test the hypothesized improvement in outcome prediction by combining biological and physical data. To select the best mathematical model, we will adapt and validate a new form of statistical model-building known as kernel-based learning. Based on our preliminary results, the kernel-based methods will likely provide a natural framework for understanding the interactions among the different physical and biological variables resulting in an effectively optimal predictive model. In summary, we propose to test the combination of biological/biomarker data and dose data to improve our ability to predict radiotherapy complications. In particular, we will use detectable blood-based biomarkers as well as treatment dose distribution characteristics to potentially improve our ability to predict (or avoid) radiation pneumonitis.

The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment.

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,8404111,R01CA127219,[''],NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2011,348026,TX-09,0.18833191626246673
"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease. It will generate new experimental data for early detection of lung cancer, and has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer, a leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.                  This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease.

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset.

"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                  Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high.

"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our broad long-term goal is to develop a convenient, non-invasive, clinically-used blood biomarker test that can distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with benign nodules for the early detection of lung cancer.  Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over-diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening, which adds both to their psychological and to their financial burden. It is urgent to develop new non-invasive methods such as identifying blood molecular biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.  Our immediate objective for this proposal is to identify blood lipid markers for the early detection of lung cancer. Lipids have numerous critical biological functions which include membrane structure, energy storage, and signal transduction. Lipids have also been implicated as playing roles in several human diseases, including lung cancer. However, studies generally have been focused on total levels of lipids in a class. Because individual species of a lipid class may have different functions, it is essential to measure their compositions. In the proposed study, we will adopt lipidomics technology which aims to quantify a cell's lipidome, identifying and quantifying individual lipid molecular species on a large scale using mass spectrometry. Our preliminary studies with lung and prostate cancer indicate this technology is robust and promising. We have identified a lipid profile difference between non-lung cancer and lung cancer plasma samples. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing non-cancer and lung cancer samples are over 90%. Our hypothesis is that lipidomics profiles will be different between lung cancer and non-malignant cancer plasma samples including benign pulmonary lesions and we will be able to define a lipid list as a predictive signature of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) measure the levels of lipid species in human plasma from non-malignant and lung cancer biospecimens. 2) Mine lipid profile data to identify ""lipid markers"" that vary reproducibly between non-malignant samples and lung cancer samples. 3) Validate and test the predictive value of the lipid markers using independent samples.  Lipidomics is a rapidly developing novel technology that has not been applied to lung cancer studies. This work could lead to potentially new clinically used markers for early detection of lung cancer. Our findings may provide information that will lead to the development of novel lipid-related drugs to treat lung cancer. In the long term, linking our data with gene expression and proteomics data in lung cancer will give us a complete view of lipid metabolic pathways and networks, as well as new knowledge about their role in lung cancer development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to identify lipid biomarkers in human blood for the early detection of lung cancer using a new technology called lipidomics, which aims to measure all the lipids in a human body. We suppose the composition and amount of lipids in early-stage lung cancer patients are different from non-lung cancer patients. Based on this, we can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over- diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening. Results from the proposed work will be of significant value to public health because we can eventually develop an invasive, accurate test tool to be clinically used for the early detection of lung cancer, which can save thousands of lives.            ",EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING,8445920,R21CA164764,"['Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Granulomatous Lesion ', ' Granuloma ', ' Hamartoma ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Lysophosphatidic Acids ', ' Lysophospholipids ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphatidylcholines ', ' Choline Phosphoglycerides ', ' Choline Glycerophospholipids ', ' Lecithin ', ' O-(1-beta-acyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-ethanolamine ', ' Ethanolamineglycerophospholipids ', ' Ethanolamine Phosphoglycerides ', ' Cephalins ', ' Phosphatidylethanolamine ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Predictive Value of Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Lung nodule ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD.

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.          This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease. It will generate new experimental data for early detection of lung cancer, and has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer, a leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.

"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                ",Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes,8580179,F32EY022558,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cues ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Evolution ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Learning ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Nodule ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Lung nodule ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' ROC Curve ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Stimulus ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Lung Cancer screening ', ' Screening for Lung Cancer ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Chest ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' p300 ', ' EP300 ', ' EP300 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Slice ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2014,36508,MA-07,0.053635365402482024
"EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our broad long-term goal is to develop a convenient, non-invasive, clinically-used blood biomarker test that can distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with benign nodules for the early detection of lung cancer.  Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over-diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening, which adds both to their psychological and to their financial burden. It is urgent to develop new non-invasive methods such as identifying blood molecular biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.  Our immediate objective for this proposal is to identify blood lipid markers for the early detection of lung cancer. Lipids have numerous critical biological functions which include membrane structure, energy storage, and signal transduction. Lipids have also been implicated as playing roles in several human diseases, including lung cancer. However, studies generally have been focused on total levels of lipids in a class. Because individual species of a lipid class may have different functions, it is essential to measure their compositions. In the proposed study, we will adopt lipidomics technology which aims to quantify a cell's lipidome, identifying and quantifying individual lipid molecular species on a large scale using mass spectrometry. Our preliminary studies with lung and prostate cancer indicate this technology is robust and promising. We have identified a lipid profile difference between non-lung cancer and lung cancer plasma samples. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing non-cancer and lung cancer samples are over 90%. Our hypothesis is that lipidomics profiles will be different between lung cancer and non-malignant cancer plasma samples including benign pulmonary lesions and we will be able to define a lipid list as a predictive signature of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) measure the levels of lipid species in human plasma from non-malignant and lung cancer biospecimens. 2) Mine lipid profile data to identify ""lipid markers"" that vary reproducibly between non-malignant samples and lung cancer samples. 3) Validate and test the predictive value of the lipid markers using independent samples.  Lipidomics is a rapidly developing novel technology that has not been applied to lung cancer studies. This work could lead to potentially new clinically used markers for early detection of lung cancer. Our findings may provide information that will lead to the development of novel lipid-related drugs to treat lung cancer. In the long term, linking our data with gene expression and proteomics data in lung cancer will give us a complete view of lipid metabolic pathways and networks, as well as new knowledge about their role in lung cancer development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to identify lipid biomarkers in human blood for the early detection of lung cancer using a new technology called lipidomics, which aims to measure all the lipids in a human body. We suppose the composition and amount of lipids in early-stage lung cancer patients are different from non-lung cancer patients. Based on this, we can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over- diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening. Results from the proposed work will be of significant value to public health because we can eventually develop an invasive, accurate test tool to be clinically used for the early detection of lung cancer, which can save thousands of lives.            ",EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING,8617255,R21CA164764,"['Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Granulomatous Lesion ', ' Granuloma ', ' Hamartoma ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Lysophosphatidic Acids ', ' Lysophospholipids ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphatidylcholines ', ' Choline Phosphoglycerides ', ' Choline Glycerophospholipids ', ' Lecithin ', ' O-(1-beta-acyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-ethanolamine ', ' Ethanolamineglycerophospholipids ', ' Ethanolamine Phosphoglycerides ', ' Cephalins ', ' Phosphatidylethanolamine ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Predictive Value of Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Lung nodule ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm.

"Computational Model of Autophagy-Mediated Survival in Chemoresistant Lung Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy is a complex intracellular recycling program associated with tumor progression and cancer cell survival. Researchers still lack strategies to effectively target this process, and an understanding of when to apply such strategies. Oncogenic stress, such as that elicited by mutant KRAS, can activate autophagy to promote cancer cell survival. Importantly, KRAS mutations are linked to 40% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. Therefore, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary research project that investigates autophagy in connection with KRAS: we will integrate predictive computational modeling and high-quality cell-based measurements to accurately model the autophagic process in KRAS-driven lung cancer. We anticipate that our model will help identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for targeting autophagy in cancer. Specific Aim #1: Validate a mechanistic model of the core autophagy pathway to predict targets for the effective inhibition of autophagy. We have specified a mechanistic model through ""rules"" that capture the key biological processes comprising the autophagy pathway. To validate this model, we measured how the individual steps of autophagy respond to physiological and oncogenic stressors, and systematic RNAi perturbations. Here, we propose to tune the model to align with quantitative data, and test predictions of the rate-limiting steps. This framework will explore the possibility that autophagy is controlled by a bistable switch, an intriguing model-derived hypothesis with therapeutic relevance. As part of this aim, we will identify effective autophagy inhibitors in wildtype and mutant KRAS backgrounds. Specific Aim #2: Model the relationship of autophagy and cell fate to test therapeutic predictions for KRAS-driven lung cancer. The autophagy model will be extended to investigate the relationship between autophagic flux and cell survival and death. For this effort, we will implement an innovative data-driven approach, which involves defining relationships between measured inputs (signaling readouts) and outputs (autophagic flux, survival, and death) in datasets. We will use this model and patient-derived cell lines to predict the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting autophagy in KRAS-driven lung cancer. Our collaborative research brings mechanistic modeling and cell biology experts together for a project that is highly relevant and valuable to public health. Mechanistic modeling was used by Los Alamos National Laboratory after World War II to assist with complex nuclear fission devices like the atomic bomb. We will use modeling to predict complex cancer cell behavior, with the ultimate goal of contributing a valuable weapon to the ""war on cancer.""         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This collaborative research brings mechanistic modeling and cell biology experts together for a project that is highly relevant and valuable to public health.

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primarily due to the lack of physical symptoms in the early stage, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. Although high-resolution computed tomography (CT) has been proved to be a sensitive, non-invasive modality for visualizing small lung nodules, which could be the early manifestation of lung cancer, a considerable number of false positive detections are often resulted. Consequently, additional procedures, such as invasive biopsy / follow-up scans, are frequently needed to verify the nature of the indeterminate nodules. The negative effects associated with these over-diagnosis procedures, such as biopsy complications, exposure to additional radiation, patient anxiety, and economic cost, significantly limits the efficacy of CT screening for early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this project, we propose to develop a computer model to quantitatively assess the nature of indeterminate nodules using a longitudinal dataset. Unlike available investigations or lung cancer risk models, we will comprehensively quantify a wide variety of properties (features) of a nodule in an unprecedented detailed manner as well as their variations over time, and synergize them with patient demographic information (e.g., age, gender, smoke history) using machine learning techniques. Not only the image features of lung nodules but also their spatial relationship with respect to important lung landmarks as well as other smoke related lung abnormalities (e.g., emphysema) will be incorporated into this model. The output of this project, namely a novel computer tool, could aid clinicians to more accurately and efficiently assess the nature of indeterminate nodules, ultimately leading to the reduction of unnecessary harm and costs to patients and the healthcare system. All these will significantly improve the efficacy of CT for early lung cancer screening by maintaining its high sensitivity while reducing false positive findings. In terms of commercial potential, the developed tool could be easily integrated with the available image information systems at medical institutions by following the widely adopted Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a novel computer tool for aiding in accurate assessment of indeterminate nodules.

"Tensor-based Dictionary Learning for Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a central concept in systems biomedicine, biomarkers are multi-scale, diverse, and inter-connected indicators of physiological and pathological states and activities. Over the past decade, the research in this area has been active and exciting, including imaging informatics based on imaging biomarkers. In this context, the genome-wide association studies are being performed to establish fundamental links between genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers but a prime challenge is that progress along this direction has been far from what was widely expected. A critical observation is that while data are exploding from genome sequencing and epigenetic analysis, in most cases medical image features are still subjective or only defined in classic fashions, which seems an unreasonable imbalance between genotypic and phenotypic worlds. Lung cancer screening is an emerging CT application and an opportunity to identify imaging biomarkers. Like other cancers, lung cancer is not one but many diseases. It is different in each patient and even in each tumor site with overwhelming nonlinearity and dynamics. It is crystal-clear that comprehensive, adaptive and individualized therapies are needed to win the battle against lung cancer. Being consistent to this big picture, research on sophisticated, instead of simplistic, biomarkers is not only helpful but also necessary in cancer research, and imaging informatics must perform exclusive and intelligent mining through rich in vivo imaging data for biomarkers so that correlative and predictive models could be established. The general hypothesis behind this R21 project is that new phenotypic information can be unlocked in tomographic data to improve sensitivity and specificity significantly in lung cancer CT screening. The overall goal of this project is to develp a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between CT lung screening results. The major innovation of this project is to synergistically integrate tensor decomposition, dictionary learning, compressive sensing, low-dose reconstruction, machine learning, locally linear embedding, super-computing and big data mining into a brand-new imaging informatics approach, which can be viewed as ""phenome sequencing"" in analog of genome sequencing. Upon the successful completion of this project, the identified imaging biomarkers will have been demonstrated instrumental in reducing the false positive rate significantly for lung CT scans while the false negative rate is kept constant.It will also help accurately stage lung cancers and non-invasively monitor cancer progression and therapeutic response. Equally important is the technical significance of this project. If it is established, a lasting impact will be generated on the field of imaging informatics at large.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between true/false positive/negative CT lung screening results.

"Computational Model of Autophagy-Mediated Survival in Chemoresistant Lung Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy is a complex intracellular recycling program associated with tumor progression and cancer cell survival. Researchers still lack strategies to effectively target this process, and an understanding of when to apply such strategies. Oncogenic stress, such as that elicited by mutant KRAS, can activate autophagy to promote cancer cell survival. Importantly, KRAS mutations are linked to 40% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. Therefore, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary research project that investigates autophagy in connection with KRAS: we will integrate predictive computational modeling and high-quality cell-based measurements to accurately model the autophagic process in KRAS-driven lung cancer. We anticipate that our model will help identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for targeting autophagy in cancer. Specific Aim #1: Validate a mechanistic model of the core autophagy pathway to predict targets for the effective inhibition of autophagy. We have specified a mechanistic model through ""rules"" that capture the key biological processes comprising the autophagy pathway. To validate this model, we measured how the individual steps of autophagy respond to physiological and oncogenic stressors, and systematic RNAi perturbations. Here, we propose to tune the model to align with quantitative data, and test predictions of the rate-limiting steps. This framework will explore the possibility that autophagy is controlled by a bistable switch, an intriguing model-derived hypothesis with therapeutic relevance. As part of this aim, we will identify effective autophagy inhibitors in wildtype and mutant KRAS backgrounds. Specific Aim #2: Model the relationship of autophagy and cell fate to test therapeutic predictions for KRAS-driven lung cancer. The autophagy model will be extended to investigate the relationship between autophagic flux and cell survival and death. For this effort, we will implement an innovative data-driven approach, which involves defining relationships between measured inputs (signaling readouts) and outputs (autophagic flux, survival, and death) in datasets. We will use this model and patient-derived cell lines to predict the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting autophagy in KRAS-driven lung cancer. Our collaborative research brings mechanistic modeling and cell biology experts together for a project that is highly relevant and valuable to public health. Mechanistic modeling was used by Los Alamos National Laboratory after World War II to assist with complex nuclear fission devices like the atomic bomb. We will use modeling to predict complex cancer cell behavior, with the ultimate goal of contributing a valuable weapon to the ""war on cancer.""

"Tensor-based Dictionary Learning for Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a central concept in systems biomedicine, biomarkers are multi-scale, diverse, and inter-connected indicators of physiological and pathological states and activities. Over the past decade, the research in this area has been active and exciting, including imaging informatics based on imaging biomarkers. In this context, the genome-wide association studies are being performed to establish fundamental links between genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers but a prime challenge is that progress along this direction has been far from what was widely expected. A critical observation is that while data are exploding from genome sequencing and epigenetic analysis, in most cases medical image features are still subjective or only defined in classic fashions, which seems an unreasonable imbalance between genotypic and phenotypic worlds. Lung cancer screening is an emerging CT application and an opportunity to identify imaging biomarkers. Like other cancers, lung cancer is not one but many diseases. It is different in each patient and even in each tumor site with overwhelming nonlinearity and dynamics. It is crystal-clear that comprehensive, adaptive and individualized therapies are needed to win the battle against lung cancer. Being consistent to this big picture, research on sophisticated, instead of simplistic, biomarkers is not only helpful but also necessary in cancer research, and imaging informatics must perform exclusive and intelligent mining through rich in vivo imaging data for biomarkers so that correlative and predictive models could be established. The general hypothesis behind this R21 project is that new phenotypic information can be unlocked in tomographic data to improve sensitivity and specificity significantly in lung cancer CT screening. The overall goal of this project is to develp a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between CT lung screening results. The major innovation of this project is to synergistically integrate tensor decomposition, dictionary learning, compressive sensing, low-dose reconstruction, machine learning, locally linear embedding, super-computing and big data mining into a brand-new imaging informatics approach, which can be viewed as ""phenome sequencing"" in analog of genome sequencing. Upon the successful completion of this project, the identified imaging biomarkers will have been demonstrated instrumental in reducing the false positive rate significantly for lung CT scans while the false negative rate is kept constant.It will also help accurately stage lung cancers and non-invasively monitor cancer progression and therapeutic response. Equally important is the technical significance of this project. If it is established, a lasting impact will be generated on the field of imaging informatics at large. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between true/false positive/negative CT lung screening results.

"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung cancer for locally advanced, inoperable disease is usually treated with radiotherapy, but the cause of severe treatment morbidity is not well understood. Using advanced data analysis methods, we will produce mathematical models that can be used to compare the risks of alternative treatment plans for individual patients, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment morbidity.        ",Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy,9107070,R01CA198121,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fractionation Radiotherapy ', ' FRACN ', ' Chemical Fractionation ', ' Fractionation ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' forest ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Death Rate ', ' Radiation-Induced Pneumonitis ', ' Radiation Pneumonia ', ' Radiation Pneumonitis ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Logistics ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' hazard ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Chest ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' irradiation ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' RTOG ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' image registration ', ' software systems ', ' conditioning ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' standard of care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' phase III trial ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' unnecessary treatment ', ' radiomics ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2016,602108,NY-12,0.15717862068843144
"Development of an Indicator Cell Assay for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are developing the Indicator Cell Assay Platform (iCAP), a broadly applicable and inexpensive blood- based assay that can be used for early detection of disease, disease stage stratification, prognosis and response to therapeutic intervention for a variety of diseases. The iCAP uses cultured cells as biosensors, capitalizing on the ability of cells to respond differently to signals present in the serum (or other biofluid) from normal or diseased subjects with exquisite sensitivity, as opposed to traditional assays that rely on direct detection of molecules in blood. Developing the iCAP involves exposing cultured cells to serum from normal or diseased subjects, measuring a global differential response pattern, and using it to build a reliable disease classifier comprised of a small number of features. Deploying the iCAP involves measuring only expression genes that are features of the disease classifier using cost-effective tools. Indicator cells are chosen based on the disease application, and those typically selected have known relationships to the disease pathology. The iCAP can overcome barriers to blood-based diagnostics like broad dynamic range of blood components, low abundance of specific markers, and high levels of noise. The focus of this proposal is to initiate development of the iCAP for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer (LC). Blood biomarkers of LC are desperately needed for use in combination with existing imaging tools to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our long-term goal is to develop a blood-based assay for clinical use on patients that have indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified by imaging to distinguish those with LC from those with benign nodules. This assay will help patients with benign nodules avoid invasive biopsy and focus further diagnostic tests on those with LC. For this Phase I study, we propose to develop an assay to reliably distinguish LC from benign nodules from patient serum samples. Specifically, we aim to 1) identify optimal indicator cells for the assay, 2) develop an iCAP-based classifier to reliably distinguish patients with lung cancer from those with benign nodules using patient serum, and 3) validate the assay by analyzing new serum samples. If we successfully achieve robust classification with >90% blind predictive accuracy and 70% sensitivity and specificity, the assay will be optimized and validated with larger cohorts in a Phase II study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a novel blood-based diagnostic tool called the indicator cell assay platform (iCAP) that uses cultured cells as biosensors to detect disease status of patients from blood samples. The iCAP will succeed where other methods have failed by exploiting cells' natural capability to amplify and integrate disease signals in blood. Here we will initiate development of an assay to robustly identify lung cancer in patients that have indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified by imaging to avoid invasive biopsy and focus further diagnostic test on those with lung cancer.            ",Development of an Indicator Cell Assay for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer,9048593,R43CA203455,"['Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' assay development ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Nodule ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Lung nodule ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Blinded ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' ']",NCI,"PRECYTE, INC.",R43,2016,299947,WA-07,0.10120805288544987
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments.

"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models. It will provide spatially- and temporally- resolved information regarding lung ventilation that will be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases.",DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS,9309904,R01EB023045,"['Air ', ' Animals ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Communities ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung Compliance ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Plethysmography ', ' pressure ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Supervision ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' lung scanning ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung imaging ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' lung volume ', ' lung injury ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' lung pressure ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Radiation ', ' rapid technique ', ' rapid method ', ' drug discovery ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Resolution ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' in vivo ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' microCT ', ' micro CT ', ' animal imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Technical Degree ', ' technical certificate ', ' efficacy study ', ' parametric imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,489676,MO-01,0.1873580113162842
"Computational Model of Autophagy-Mediated Survival in Chemoresistant Lung Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy is a complex intracellular recycling program associated with tumor progression and cancer cell survival. Researchers still lack strategies to effectively target this process, and an understanding of when to apply such strategies. Oncogenic stress, such as that elicited by mutant KRAS, can activate autophagy to promote cancer cell survival. Importantly, KRAS mutations are linked to 40% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. Therefore, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary research project that investigates autophagy in connection with KRAS: we will integrate predictive computational modeling and high-quality cell-based measurements to accurately model the autophagic process in KRAS-driven lung cancer. We anticipate that our model will help identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for targeting autophagy in cancer. Specific Aim #1: Validate a mechanistic model of the core autophagy pathway to predict targets for the effective inhibition of autophagy. We have specified a mechanistic model through ""rules"" that capture the key biological processes comprising the autophagy pathway. To validate this model, we measured how the individual steps of autophagy respond to physiological and oncogenic stressors, and systematic RNAi perturbations. Here, we propose to tune the model to align with quantitative data, and test predictions of the rate-limiting steps. This framework will explore the possibility that autophagy is controlled by a bistable switch, an intriguing model-derived hypothesis with therapeutic relevance. As part of this aim, we will identify effective autophagy inhibitors in wildtype and mutant KRAS backgrounds. Specific Aim #2: Model the relationship of autophagy and cell fate to test therapeutic predictions for KRAS-driven lung cancer. The autophagy model will be extended to investigate the relationship between autophagic flux and cell survival and death. For this effort, we will implement an innovative data-driven approach, which involves defining relationships between measured inputs (signaling readouts) and outputs (autophagic flux, survival, and death) in datasets. We will use this model and patient-derived cell lines to predict the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting autophagy in KRAS-driven lung cancer. Our collaborative research brings mechanistic modeling and cell biology experts together for a project that is highly relevant and valuable to public health. Mechanistic modeling was used by Los Alamos National Laboratory after World War II to assist with complex nuclear fission devices like the atomic bomb. We will use modeling to predict complex cancer cell behavior, with the ultimate goal of contributing a valuable weapon to the ""war on cancer.""

"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy.

"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs.

"A Systems Biology Approach to Mapping Aging in the lung PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for an NRSA Individual Fellowship is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to provide a rich environment for learning and growth to support the candidate's development into an effective physician- scientist, and 2) to generate a molecular map of aging in the lung by applying a systems biology approach to the analysis of transcriptomic data obtained over the lifespan of the laboratory mouse. The candidate and his mentors have designed a specific training plan that includes a rigorous research component and lays the foundation for a successful career. Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, however, the biological mechanisms contributing to this are not understood. The candidate will employ a systems biology approach to analyze already generated datasets to identify molecular pathways of aging in the lung. A better understanding of aging in the lung may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapies for lung diseases in older adults. Gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq has been used to generate “maps” of tissues by depicting tissues and purified constituent cellular populations on a molecular level. Transcriptional profiles from individuals with disease have been compared to those from healthy individuals in an attempt to develop “signatures” for a given disease. These signatures can be useful for disease diagnosis as well as for identifying targets for therapy. This proposal focuses on the contributions of two abundant cell populations in the lung, alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells (AT2), to the transcriptional signatures of aging in the lung. The candidate has preliminary data demonstrating evidence of an aging signature in alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells purified from mice at 18 months compared with 3 months. This signature persists during an influenza A virus infection challenge. The purpose of this proposal is to employ a systems biology approach to analyze transcriptomic data already obtained by investigators in the candidate's laboratory that includes whole lung tissue, alveolar macrophages, and AT2 cells harvested from mice over the lifespan (2 weeks, and 6,12,18 and 24 months of age). In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will generate a transcriptional map of aging in murine whole lung and purified cellular populations of alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will determine whether the transcriptional signature of aging in alveolar macrophages is cell autonomous or is driven by changes in the alveolar local microenvironment. Over the course of this award, the candidate will learn new systems biology approaches to analyzing large time-series genomic datasets and will develop a comprehensive understanding of the age-related changes in the innate immune system of the lung. The skills developed as part of this project will serve as a guide for the analysis of similar genomic data harvested from aging humans with lung disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, and lung infections. The mechanisms contributing to the increased susceptibility of older adults to these diseases are unknown.

"Computational Model of Autophagy-Mediated Survival in Chemoresistant Lung Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy is a complex intracellular recycling program associated with tumor progression and cancer cell survival. Researchers still lack strategies to effectively target this process, and an understanding of when to apply such strategies. Oncogenic stress, such as that elicited by mutant KRAS, can activate autophagy to promote cancer cell survival. Importantly, KRAS mutations are linked to 40% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. Therefore, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary research project that investigates autophagy in connection with KRAS: we will integrate predictive computational modeling and high-quality cell-based measurements to accurately model the autophagic process in KRAS-driven lung cancer. We anticipate that our model will help identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for targeting autophagy in cancer. Specific Aim #1: Validate a mechanistic model of the core autophagy pathway to predict targets for the effective inhibition of autophagy. We have specified a mechanistic model through ""rules"" that capture the key biological processes comprising the autophagy pathway. To validate this model, we measured how the individual steps of autophagy respond to physiological and oncogenic stressors, and systematic RNAi perturbations. Here, we propose to tune the model to align with quantitative data, and test predictions of the rate-limiting steps. This framework will explore the possibility that autophagy is controlled by a bistable switch, an intriguing model-derived hypothesis with therapeutic relevance. As part of this aim, we will identify effective autophagy inhibitors in wildtype and mutant KRAS backgrounds. Specific Aim #2: Model the relationship of autophagy and cell fate to test therapeutic predictions for KRAS-driven lung cancer. The autophagy model will be extended to investigate the relationship between autophagic flux and cell survival and death. For this effort, we will implement an innovative data-driven approach, which involves defining relationships between measured inputs (signaling readouts) and outputs (autophagic flux, survival, and death) in datasets. We will use this model and patient-derived cell lines to predict the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting autophagy in KRAS-driven lung cancer. Our collaborative research brings mechanistic modeling and cell biology experts together for a project that is highly relevant and valuable to public health. Mechanistic modeling was used by Los Alamos National Laboratory after World War II to assist with complex nuclear fission devices like the atomic bomb. We will use modeling to predict complex cancer cell behavior, with the ultimate goal of contributing a valuable weapon to the ""war on cancer.""

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening.

"2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting scheduled for December 6-8, 2018, which will be the sixth of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and housing expenses for undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty speakers. Some may also be used to support live webcasting and publication of the workshop proceedings. As in the past, it is our intention to broadcast each session of the meeting online in real-time, enabling interested parties who cannot physically attend to access them free of charge. Pulmonary diseases constitute a significant and rising cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and imaging is becoming an increasingly important source of innovative techniques for both diagnosing and treating these pathologies. The field of pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the functional, structural and molecular assessment of lung disorders than ever before, which are being developed and refined by investigators across a diverse set of fields such as biology, physics, chemistry, medicine and engineering, computer science and machine learning. Given the rapidly-developing nature of the pulmonary imaging field, it is of the utmost importance that a regular forum exists for scientists and clinicians to communicate and debate their ideas with one another. In the absence of other meetings with a similar focus, our previous workshops have provided such a forum, bringing together the diverse components of the field into the kind of rigorous, focused exchange needed to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed about the latest developments in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (2) examine the use of pulmonary imaging to assess therapeutic response, including strategies for overcoming the challenges inherent in this objective; (3) explore the integration of machine learning with pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (4) broadcast the entire proceedings live over the web, allowing non-attendees to freely access the proceedings, and enabling the online audience to participate in workshop discussions in real-time. Based on feedback from participants that previous meetings tended to be overly dense and predominantly didactic in nature, we have also implemented a significant format change for proposed 2018 meeting. With the exception of a few keynote presentations, we plan to limit the percentage of formal lecture in each invited speaker’s talk to one-third of their allotted time, with the rest dedicated to a period of discussion that will be driven by a panel of moderators as well as audience questions. For each presentation, the moderators will prepare a list of questions focusing on three main points: 1) the translatability of the research being presented, 2) the scientific gap which this research aims to address, and 3) the necessity of identifying lung disorders that are suitable for longitudinal studies, as well as which imaging parameters are best suited to the longitudinal study of lung disease. In addition to this change in format, the 2018 workshop will continue efforts to strike a more even balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease. Finally, we will also continue to foreground the important issue of using imaging techniques to assess treatment response, which was first introduced at the 2017 pulmonary imaging workshop. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. The proposed meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for researchers engaged in the development of functional, structural, and molecular imaging techniques for assessing lung diseases—such as COPD, ARDS, IPF and lung cancer—to meet and discuss their work with one another. The entirety of the workshop will be broadcast live online, giving interested individuals who are not able to attend in person the ability to both view and participate in its proceedings.",2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop,9613494,R13HL144010,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biology ', ' Charge ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Heart ', ' Housing ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Protons ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Rest ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Schedule ', ' Intention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' lung scanning ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung imaging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecule imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' disease phenotype ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging approach ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R13,2018,29805,PA-03,0.04134979030797533
"DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models. It will provide spatially- and temporally- resolved information regarding lung ventilation that will be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases.",DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS,9474118,R01EB023045,"['Air ', ' Animals ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Communities ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung Compliance ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Plethysmography ', ' pressure ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Supervision ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Ventilation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' lung scanning ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung imaging ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' lung volume ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' lung pressure ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Radiation ', ' rapid technique ', ' rapid method ', ' drug discovery ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Resolution ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' in vivo ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' micro CT ', ' microCT ', ' animal imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' technical certificate ', ' Technical Degree ', ' efficacy study ', ' parametric imaging ', ' in vivo monitoring ', ' ']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,408541,MO-01,0.1873580113162842
"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer.

"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening.

"The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen- induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury (bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease. Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host- derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia. This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies, yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and severe lung disease. We have recently discovered that the lung microbiome - the communities of microbes living in the respiratory tract - are altered by inhaled oxygen and necessary for the development of oxygen-induced lung injury.

"Genetic interaction analysis involving oncogenesis-related genes in lung cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  The development of cancer diseases is driven by the accumulation of many oncogenesis-related genetic alterations and tumorigenesis is triggered by complex networks of involved genes rather than independent actions. The interactions among genetic factors are believed to play important roles in carcinogenesis and contribute to the missing heritability. In this proposal, we designed a filtered gene-gene interaction analysis aiming to identify the epistasis involving important oncogenesis-related genes. Besides the advantage of dimensional reduction and increased power, this filtered interaction analysis will help us identify novel oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes implicated in lung cancer development that will not be revealed in main effect association analysis. It will also identify novel susceptibility variants, including those in intergenic and non-coding regions, affecting lung cancer risk by interacting/modulating with oncogenesis-related genes. Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease and researchers have identified vast differences in genomic attributes. However, the knowledge about epistatic features in lung cancer subtypes is limited. We will conduct a stratified epistasis analysis by lung cancer histology subtype in the proposed study to reveal subtype-specific genetic interactions and gene networks. The stratified analysis by histology will enhance our understanding about this complicated disease mechanism in lung cancer and has the potential to contribute to precision medicine in lung cancer treatment.  A main challenge in genetic association studies is to understand the functional consequences of identified genetic variants. In this study, we proposed functional annotation analysis including eQTL gene expression analysis, pathway and gene network analysis, and functional annotation of epistasis-involved SNPs. This integrative epistasis and functional annotation analysis will help us pinpoint the causal epistasis and characterize the epistasis-involved genes or regions in lung cancer risk development. It will be a pilot study to explore how the regulatory non-coding variants impact lung cancer risk by interacting with oncogenesis-related genes.  The proposed study will provide insights about the complicated biological interactions that are critical for gene regulation, biochemical networks, and developmental pathways implicated in lung carcinogenesis. In order to finish the proposed study, we collected the genotype data from three independent GWAS studies including 24,037 lung cancer patients and 20,401 healthy controls from the Caucasian population. The genotype and gene expression data in lung tissues from 409 individuals will be applied for eQTL gene expression analysis.

"Development of a Rapid Method for Imaging Regional Ventilation in Small Animals w/o Contrast Agents The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models.

"Computational Model of Autophagy-Mediated Survival in Chemoresistant Lung Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy is a complex intracellular recycling program associated with tumor progression and cancer cell survival. Researchers still lack strategies to effectively target this process, and an understanding of when to apply such strategies. Oncogenic stress, such as that elicited by mutant KRAS, can activate autophagy to promote cancer cell survival. Importantly, KRAS mutations are linked to 40% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. Therefore, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary research project that investigates autophagy in connection with KRAS: we will integrate predictive computational modeling and high-quality cell-based measurements to accurately model the autophagic process in KRAS-driven lung cancer. We anticipate that our model will help identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for targeting autophagy in cancer. Specific Aim #1: Validate a mechanistic model of the core autophagy pathway to predict targets for the effective inhibition of autophagy. We have specified a mechanistic model through ""rules"" that capture the key biological processes comprising the autophagy pathway. To validate this model, we measured how the individual steps of autophagy respond to physiological and oncogenic stressors, and systematic RNAi perturbations. Here, we propose to tune the model to align with quantitative data, and test predictions of the rate-limiting steps. This framework will explore the possibility that autophagy is controlled by a bistable switch, an intriguing model-derived hypothesis with therapeutic relevance. As part of this aim, we will identify effective autophagy inhibitors in wildtype and mutant KRAS backgrounds. Specific Aim #2: Model the relationship of autophagy and cell fate to test therapeutic predictions for KRAS-driven lung cancer. The autophagy model will be extended to investigate the relationship between autophagic flux and cell survival and death. For this effort, we will implement an innovative data-driven approach, which involves defining relationships between measured inputs (signaling readouts) and outputs (autophagic flux, survival, and death) in datasets. We will use this model and patient-derived cell lines to predict the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting autophagy in KRAS-driven lung cancer. Our collaborative research brings mechanistic modeling and cell biology experts together for a project that is highly relevant and valuable to public health. Mechanistic modeling was used by Los Alamos National Laboratory after World War II to assist with complex nuclear fission devices like the atomic bomb. We will use modeling to predict complex cancer cell behavior, with the ultimate goal of contributing a valuable weapon to the ""war on cancer.""

"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,9740637,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Endothelium ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genotype ', ' Histology ', ' Learning ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' lung fibrosis ', ' Pulmonary Fibrosis ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' improved ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Genetic ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' c new ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Tomography, Computed, Scanners ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' microCT ', ' micro CT ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' symptomatology ', ' recruit ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' CT screening ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,790346,NY-13,0.029005758414394647
"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",9646106,K23HL145011,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Dysbarism ', ' Barotrauma ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Computers ', ' Critical Care ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Endothelium ', ' Foundations ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Manometry Biochemistry ', ' Manometry ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' pressure ', ' Prone Position ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' ARDS ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Measures ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Ventilator ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Epithelial ', ' esophagus pressure ', ' esophageal pressure ', ' Induction of neuromuscular blockade ', ' Neuromuscular Blockade ', ' Neuromuscular Block ', ' Individual ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Alveolar ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Esophageal ', ' injured ', ' computerized ', ' Ventilator-induced lung injury ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' trial comparing ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biological systems ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' individual patient ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2019,170640,CO-06,0.06999207578967852
"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer has a high fatality rate because most patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the disease is more difficult to cure.

"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease.

"Deep Radiomic Analysis of Coronary Heart Disease with Lung Screening CT Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) caused 17.7 million deaths in 2015, accounting for one third of all deaths globally. Amongst 8.8 million cancer-deaths in 2015, lung cancer contributed to 1.69 million deaths worldwide. In the United States, lung cancer will claim 154,050 lives in 2018, representing a quarter of all cancer deaths. Both CVDs and lung cancer share several risk factors, including unhealthy dietary patterns, obesity, and tobacco use. Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT), an effective lung cancer screening technique, reduces the cancer-related mortality rate by 20% in those with history of heavy smoking. Such subjects have substantially higher risk of CVDs than lung cancer. Indeed, most subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with LDCT have an intermediate to high risk for CVDs. Concomitant CVD screening will have profound benefits for these subjects at no additional time, cost, or radiation dose to the patient. The goal of the project is to develop an automated workflow of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk (CARMOR) evaluation with lung cancer screening LDCT data to provide high-risk subjects a “radiation-free” CVD screening without cost or time constraints. Our central hypothesis is that deep radiomics from LDCT follow-up scans and across different reconstructions can effectively improve the performance of CARMOR estimation. To validate our hypothesis, we will perform radiomics analysis on CARMOR with lung cancer screening LDCT scans, and then further enhance the CARMOR features with complementary image reconstructions from the same scan and serial LDCT scans for optimized prognostic performance. The CARMOR quantification methods in lung screening LDCT will be validated retrospectively against multiple subspecialty radiologists with Coronary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CCTA) as the standard of reference. The project requires us to perform analyses over serial LDCT exams and different reconstruction techniques and settings. Therefore, major innovations and improvements need to be made for this challenging deep radiomic analysis task. Since the risk factors of CVDs and lung cancer are closely related with lifestyle, the findings of the project can also be used to create teachable moments for patients to change towards healthier lifestyles. In context of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement of LDCT for lung cancer screening and stress on the importance of considering co-morbidities, our timely project will have a significant impact on the healthcare of a large population. At the end of the project, we will have developed an automated workflow of assessing CARMOR for lung screening LDCT with zero radiation added. We will also have acquired study results to enable personalized patient education to address the long-term health crisis caused by unhealthy lifestyles. Our studies will lead to new understanding of deep radiomics in CVD screening and the impact of LDCT reconstructions in clinical practice. Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is effective in lung cancer screening and can reduce the mortality rate by 20% for the high-risk population. However, heavy smokers are affected by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) even more than by lung cancer and most high-risk subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with LDCT have an intermediate to high risk for CVDs.

"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9693200,U01CA216459,"['Anxiety ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cause of Death ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' database systems ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Lobectomy ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nodule ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Lung nodule ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Solid ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Evaluation ', ' Indolent ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' radiologist ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Descriptor ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' attenuation ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Property ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' low-dose spiral CT ', ' low-dose helical computed tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' Screening Result ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' unnecessary treatment ', ' radiomics ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinically translatable ', ' screening program ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' CT screening ', ' pathology imaging ', ' automated image analysis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,440946,MI-12,0.2711463039459855
"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung cancer for locally advanced, inoperable disease is usually treated with radiotherapy, but the cause of severe treatment morbidity is not well understood. Using advanced data analysis methods, we will produce mathematical models that can be used to compare the risks of alternative treatment plans for individual patients, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment morbidity.",Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy,9685174,R01CA198121,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Cause of Death ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fractionation Radiotherapy ', ' FRACN ', ' Chemical Fractionation ', ' Fractionation ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Death Rate ', ' Radiation Pneumonitis ', ' Radiation-Induced Pneumonitis ', ' Radiation Pneumonia ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Logistics ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' hazard ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Locally Advanced Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preconditioning ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' irradiation ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' RTOG ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Characteristics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' image registration ', ' software systems ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' standard of care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' phase III trial ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' unnecessary treatment ', ' radiomics ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' random forest ', ' classification trees ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,579921,NY-12,0.15717862068843144
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs.

"Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the second-most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Among the different types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type and it constitutes 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. Current cancer research has shown that multiple somatic mutations affect the sensitivity of patients to various drugs used for NSCLC treatment. These mutations are essential factors for determining the most effective, “personalized” treatment for each NSCLC patient; however, most NSCLC patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies in their first year of treatment. Many mechanisms of this resistance are still unknown. Designing and prescribing better targeted therapies for NSCLC patients requires further understanding, particularly with respect to the relationship between NSCLC tumors’ pathological and clinical findings, genetic profiles, and targeted therapy responses/resistance. Currently, there is no computational method to connect observations and findings from pathology reports, medical records, somatic mutations, and the targeted therapy resistance. This project provides a plan to build a novel computational method to identify statistically significant associations between the pathological findings of NSCLC tumors and the presence of clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Furthermore, these associations, in combination with an innovative set of feature analysis from pathology reports and electronic medical records, will be leveraged to build and validate a machine-learning model to identify NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Finally, the associated clinical, pathological, and genetic findings for NSCLC patients will be used in a new machine-learning framework to predict patients’ time-to-resistance to targeted therapies. The required data to build and validate the proposed models in this project will be obtained through a collaboration with the Department of Pathology’s Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technologies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to internal validation, the investigators in this proposal established a collaboration with the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont Medical Center to apply and validate the developed models on an external data source. Upon successful implementation of this bioinformatics approach, the developed models will be able to reveal statistically significant links between clinical and pathological findings, clinically-actionable somatic mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for a better understanding of NSCLC tumor development and treatment. The proposed approach will provide an accurate, fast, and inexpensive pre- selection method for screening NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable mutations for translational research and precision medicine. Furthermore, the proposed machine-learning method to identify NSCLC patients’ resistance to targeted therapies will help healthcare providers to select the best treatment strategies for these patients, improve their health outcomes, and establish this precision medicine paradigm for other types of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Resistance to targeted therapies severely limits the ability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This project proposes a novel computational approach to find statistically-significant links between pathological and clinical findings, clinically-actionable mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for NSCLC patients.

"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer.

"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Lung-on-a-chip pulmonary fibrosis model for drug discovery LUNG-ON-A-CHIP PULMONARY FIBROSIS MODEL FOR DRUG DISCOVERY PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a devastating disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and associated scar formation that compromises breathing function and often leads to respiratory failure and death. There are multiple etiologies of PF, including environmental particles, radiation, and even certain antibiotics, but in most cases patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) where the specific trigger is unknown. There is no cure for IPF as current treatments are only capable of slowing lung damage, and prognosis is poor, with a median survival time of 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. A significant barrier to the development of PF therapeutics is interspecies differences in lung physiology and associated inflammatory and immune responses such that animal models do not sufficiently recapitulate certain aspects of the disease. Recent advances in human organs-on-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture systems that recapitulate the multicellular architecture, tissue-tissue interfaces, mechanical environment (e.g., cyclic breathing motions), and vascular perfusion of major organ functional units have allowed for physiologically based evaluation of cell, environmental, and drug interactions within an organ-level context in vitro. We can utilize these Organ Chips to gain complementary data to animal models about the role of specific cellular contributions to PF development. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop a human Organ Chip model of PF to better understand the mechanism of fibrosis development and progression, and to discover potential new therapeutics that could slow disease progression or reverse this deadly disease. This goal will be achieved with the following two aims: human PF Chips will be engineered with myofibroblasts from healthy donors and PF patients, with the addition of various environmental stimuli as well as potential inflammatory and immune contributors implicated in PF development (Aim 1), and transcriptomics data from these PF Chips will be compared to existing genomics literature data to identify drugs to use as potential PF therapeutics, prioritizing for clinically approved drugs that can be repurposed (Aim 2). This approach is innovative because it will be the first to incorporate all the major components of a human lung microenvironment critical for fibrosis development (human tissue-tissue interactions, breathing motions, perfusion, and environmental stimuli). Completion of these aims will enable analysis of the mechanism of PF development, with the capability to rapidly repurpose existing FDA- approved drugs as potentially life-saving PF therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary fibrosis is a common and devastating disorder without effective pharmacological treatment options, leading to a median survival time of only 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. To complement animal research models for screening of potential therapeutics, we propose the development of a pulmonary fibrosis model using a cell-based platform that recapitulates the human lung microenvironment. The goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis through characterization of the contribution of donor fibroblasts, environmental factors, and immune and inflammatory cell mediators, then use the knowledge of mechanistic elements to aid in the discovery of new therapeutics for treating pulmonary fibrosis.",Lung-on-a-chip pulmonary fibrosis model for drug discovery,9682914,F32HL146070,"['Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Bleomycin ', ' Bleo ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Scars ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Collagen ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' γ-Ray ', ' γ-Radiation ', ' Gamma Radiation ', ' Gamma Rays ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Institutes ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' macrophage ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' neutrophil ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' lung alveolus ', ' Pulmonary Alveoli ', ' Pulmonary alveolar structure ', ' lung fibrosis ', ' Pulmonary Fibrosis ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Myofibroblast ', ' Stimulus ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' chemokine ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' human tissue ', ' System ', ' Particulate ', ' particle ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Alveolar ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combinatorial ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' FDA approved ', ' screening ', ' human model ', ' idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ', ' diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis ', ' organ on a chip ', ' organ on chip ', ' ']",NHLBI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,34725,MA-05,0.05907005814809164
"Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the second-most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Among the different types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type and it constitutes 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. Current cancer research has shown that multiple somatic mutations affect the sensitivity of patients to various drugs used for NSCLC treatment. These mutations are essential factors for determining the most effective, “personalized” treatment for each NSCLC patient; however, most NSCLC patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies in their first year of treatment. Many mechanisms of this resistance are still unknown. Designing and prescribing better targeted therapies for NSCLC patients requires further understanding, particularly with respect to the relationship between NSCLC tumors’ pathological and clinical findings, genetic profiles, and targeted therapy responses/resistance. Currently, there is no computational method to connect observations and findings from pathology reports, medical records, somatic mutations, and the targeted therapy resistance. This project provides a plan to build a novel computational method to identify statistically significant associations between the pathological findings of NSCLC tumors and the presence of clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Furthermore, these associations, in combination with an innovative set of feature analysis from pathology reports and electronic medical records, will be leveraged to build and validate a machine-learning model to identify NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Finally, the associated clinical, pathological, and genetic findings for NSCLC patients will be used in a new machine-learning framework to predict patients’ time-to-resistance to targeted therapies. The required data to build and validate the proposed models in this project will be obtained through a collaboration with the Department of Pathology’s Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technologies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to internal validation, the investigators in this proposal established a collaboration with the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont Medical Center to apply and validate the developed models on an external data source. Upon successful implementation of this bioinformatics approach, the developed models will be able to reveal statistically significant links between clinical and pathological findings, clinically-actionable somatic mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for a better understanding of NSCLC tumor development and treatment. The proposed approach will provide an accurate, fast, and inexpensive pre- selection method for screening NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable mutations for translational research and precision medicine. Furthermore, the proposed machine-learning method to identify NSCLC patients’ resistance to targeted therapies will help healthcare providers to select the best treatment strategies for these patients, improve their health outcomes, and establish this precision medicine paradigm for other types of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Resistance to targeted therapies severely limits the ability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This project proposes a novel computational approach to find statistically-significant links between pathological and clinical findings, clinically-actionable mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for NSCLC patients.

"The benefits and harms of lung cancer screening in Florida PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States. Currently, approximately 70% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced stage lung cancer is very low, at only 16%. Investigators have been searching for effective screening modalities for the early detection of lung cancer so that patients can receive curative treatments at an early stage. When the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan for lung cancer screening (LCS), researchers and physicians hope to save lives from lung cancer by screening high-risk population who aged 55 to 77 years and have a 30 pack years making history or former smokes who have quitted within the past 15 years. Since the release of the landmark NLST results, many medical associations published guidelines to recommend LDCT-based screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also decided to cover the LCS for Medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk for lung cancer. While many efforts have been made to accelerate the dissemination the beneficial LCS, the concerns over the high false positive rates (96.4% of the positive results), invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications and health care costs may hinder the utilization of lung cancer screening. This concern was magnified as researchers and policy makers started questioning whether the complication rate and false positives in real-world settings would be even higher than the rates reported in the NLST, which was conducted in a setting with well-established facilities and proficiency in cancer care. Therefore, we propose to understand the contemporary use of lung cancer screening and associated health care outcomes and costs using data from a real-world setting. Our study has three goals: 1) to develop an innovative computable phenotype algorithm to identify high-risk and low-risk individuals for LCS from both structured and unstructured (i.e., clinical notes) electronic health record (EHR) data and to develop advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract LCS related clinical information from clinical notes such as radiology reports; 2) to determine the appropriate and inappropriate use of LDCT among high-risk and low-risk individuals in Florida and to examine the test results of LDCT, the rates of invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and incidental findings in real-world settings; and 3) to develop and validate a microsimulation model of the clinical courses of LCS incorporating the real-world data in LCS to estimate the long-term benefits and the cost-effectiveness of LCS. Our proposed study has the potential to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality by informing policymakers and practitioners on the appropriateness of contemporary use of LCS. This knowledge will help both patients and physicians better understand the harm- benefit tradeoff of lung cancer screening and transform such knowledge into practice to prevent avoidable postprocedural complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer screening using Low-dose computed tomography is a promising technique to reduce the burden of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Concerns over high false positives, invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and downstream health care costs impede developing and promoting lung cancer screening program.

"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",9846014,K23HL145011,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Dysbarism ', ' Barotrauma ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Critical Care ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Endothelium ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Esophagus ', ' Foundations ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Manometry ', ' Manometry Biochemistry ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' pressure ', ' Prone Position ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Measures ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Ventilator ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Epithelial ', ' esophageal pressure ', ' esophagus pressure ', ' Neuromuscular Block ', ' Neuromuscular Blockade ', ' Induction of neuromuscular blockade ', ' Individual ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Alveolar ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' computerized ', ' Ventilator-induced lung injury ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' trial comparing ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biological systems ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' individual patient ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized strategies ', ' improved outcome ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ventilation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2020,170640,CO-06,0.06999207578967852
"Systems Biology in Vaping Product Exposure ABSTRACT Inhalation of electronically aerosolized vapors, or vaping, has grown substantially in the past decade. A recent outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) has raised concern for the public health impact of the behavior. Effects on the lung both acutely and chronically are not well-understood, and mechanisms of lung damage have not been fully elucidated. EVALI cases are in part thought to be due to in- halation of toxic chemicals, such as vitamin E acetate, contained within the diluent of the product; however, factors determining individual susceptibility to EVALI are unclear. Changes in the metabolic milieu of the lung could also alter the structure and function of the lung microbiome, further perpetuating injury. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated alterations in the lung metabolome in EVALI patients compared to individuals with lung injury from other causes and to a healthy control and an HIV-infected individual with chronic vape use as well as alterations in pulmonary function with chronic vaping. In the current proposal, we will measure multi- ple parallel molecular and clinical datasets to test the hypothesis that interactions of the metabolome, microbi- ome, and the host are critical in development of injury secondary to e-vapor exposure. We will build a compre- hensive, systems-level model of the cellular and microbial milieu in the lung of subjects with chronic e-vapor exposure and from inpatients with acute EVALI to understand the transition from chronic exposure to acute injury. We will apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to better understand and clas- sify features distinguishing acute vaping induced lung injury from non-vaping associated lung injury and from chronic lung injury related to e-vapor exposure. In addition, we will develop a novel ex vivo lung perfusion model that can be used for future mechanistic studies arising from our investigations. Leveraging the infra- structure within the Systems Biology of Diffusion Impairment in HIV study (R01HL140963), we have the oppor- tunity to examine a continuum of vaping and lung impairment including chronic vaping in a healthy population, chronic vaping in HIV+ individuals who may have enhanced susceptibility to vaping, and in patients with EVALI through the following aims: Aim 1: To identify causal molecular pathways underlying the host response to chronic e-vapor exposure by integrating clinical features and -omics data from ambulatory individuals. Aim 2: To identify predictive signatures of respiratory impairment from clinical features, transcriptomic, microbiome, and metabolomic data using clinical specimens from hospitalized individuals with EVALI. Aim 3: To develop a clinically relevant ex-vivo model of ENDD exposure to facilitate mechanistic investigation and evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions. This project will leverage existing resources to identify complex associations and causal relationships in vaping-associated lung injury and lay the groundwork for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Our study will fill a gap in understanding of the transcriptional, metabolic and microbial landscape of the respiratory tract in individuals with both chronic exposure to e-vapor products and EVALI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhalation of electronically aerosolized vapors, or vaping, has grown substantially in the past decade.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for

"Development of a Novel Lung Function Imaging Modality for comprehensive management of lung cancer Our project proposes an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging modality into clinical care for lung cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Lung cancer patients being treated with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality, referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side- effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using 4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT- ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry partnership with MIM Software to address these challenges precluding clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation.  The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT- ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.  Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients and our project will enable the integration of this novel imaging modality into clinical care. Our project proposes to form an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging modality into radiotherapy clinical care for lung cancer patients. The novel lung function imaging modality is referred to as `4DCT-ventilation,' and uses 4-Dimensional CT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively calculate lung functional maps. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.

"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions.

"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy.

"The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.  BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating chronic lung disease with debilitating long-term consequences, affects approximately half of all infants born extremely preterm. The objectives of this proposal are relevant to public health because they aim to establish that bacterial communities in the gut influence development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by altering the immune responses of the developing lung. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into extra-pulmonary contributions to lung development and characterize new targets for therapy, which addresses goals of the NIH to seek mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in the pathobiology of lung diseases and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease during early life.",The gut-lung axis influences the development of

"SonoHeal: Smart Resonating Closed-loop Airway Clearance Device Project Summary  Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects 30,000 patients in the USA with an average life span of 37 years and the majority (85%) of the mortality is a result of lung disease. Airway Clearance Therapies (ACT) are extensively used by patients for forceful mechanical clearance of mucus accumulated in airways using high pressure and high frequency vibrations. However, the use of ACTs is intrusive, painful, uncomfortable, and poses tremendous burden on patients who are required to perform ACTs daily for 1-2 hours. Without effective ACT, the mucus-plugged airways trap bacteria causing infections, inflammations, respiratory failures, and other complications. ACT is also used by patients with lung conditions where mucus clearance is necessary (e.g. bronchiectasis, COPD, Asthma).  ACT works on the principle of vibrating the lungs to increase mucus mobility. Ideally, the therapy needs to be individualized and continuously adaptive for effective clearance. However, none of the current ACT devices and techniques, including chest physiotherapy, high-frequency chest compression, oscillation, and acoustic vibration therapies, are adaptive. The challenges with current ACT devices: 1. Brute-force approach: Patients have diverse airway geometry, mucus accretion levels, and obstruction locations. Optimal therapy requires input frequencies to match the resonant frequency of specific airways to target mucus clearance. Current ACT devices work on a set vibration pattern (Vest, oPEP, CPT) or a “feeling- based” subjective tweaking of input frequencies and airway location (Frequencer, VibraLung), often rendering them ineffective. 2. Subjective Assessment: None of the current devices measure lung function to provide a quantitative assessment of the airway obstruction or therapy progress putting the burden on the patient to determine treatment effectiveness. 3. Poor Quality of Life: As a result, patients perform uncomfortable ACT for long durations to see a positive effect, leading to poor adherence to ACT. Further, home ACTs are considered ineffective for a large segment of the patient population due to the lack of personalized treatment. Cognita Labs’s proposed solution, SonoHeal, will be the first device to adapt the treatment in real-time based on the patient’s lung status, such that the right airways are targeted for stimulation/vibration to reduce the reliance on patient’s guesswork as well as provide effective therapy by localizing airway clearance. SonoHeal will utilize Cognita’s patent-pending airway monitoring technology that measures airway obstruction in real- time. Combined with quantified lung response with mucus localization information, SonoHeal will algorithmically tune the right resonant frequency to target patient’s airways and promote effective mucus removal. In this proposal, Cognita’s team will bring years of airway modeling, device technologies and commercialization experience to conduct in-vitro experimentation on multiple lung models to show the feasibility and efficiency of the SonoHeal device in a lab setup. PROJECT NARRATIVE Airway Clearance Therapies (ACT) are critical daily requirement for Cystic Fibrosis patients to remove mucus from the lungs and avoid infections and pulmonary exacerbations. Current ACT devices work on the principals of violently vibrating/shaking the lung which leads to ineffective, uncomfortable and long therapy times. Cognita’s SonoHeal will be the first closed- loop innovation that will listen to the lung response while adaptively changing acoustic vibrating pressure waves to target the resonant frequencies of the individual airways and provide most efficient and effective therapy.",SonoHeal: Smart Resonating Closed-loop Airway Clearance Device,10011518,R43HL152912,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' airway obstruction ', ' airflow limitation ', ' airflow obstruction ', ' airway limitation ', ' obstructed airflow ', ' obstructed airway ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bronchiectasis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elasticity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Knee ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mucins ', ' Mucus Glycoprotein ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Obstruction ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' lung function ', ' respiratory function ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' electric impedance ', ' base ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' phase II protocol ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' patient safety ', ' High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation ', ' High-Frequency Chest Compression ', ' High-Frequency Chest Wall Compression ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Germ ', ' Localized Therapy ', ' Local Therapy ', ' Monitor ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D Print ', ' Geometry ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' mucus clearance ', ' learning algorithm ', ' adaptation algorithm ', ' ventilation ', ' ']",NHLBI,"COGNITA LABS, LLC",R43,2020,197130,CA-09,0.1000057521247118
"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,9967745,R21EB028367,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Cardiomegaly ', ' Enlarged Heart ', ' Heart Enlargement ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mydriasis ', ' Pupil Dilation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Pleural effusion disorder ', ' Pleural Effusion ', ' pleural cavity effusion ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Pupil ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Speech ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' CXR ', ' chest X ray ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest radiography ', ' lung radiography ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' thorax radiography ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' radiologist ', ' Localized Disease ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' data collection methodology ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' medical attention ', ' screening ', ' model building ', ' CT screening ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' learning algorithm ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' low dose computerized tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,243364,UT-02,0.009095415336360607
"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules.

"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways.

"Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted society, communities, and the healthcare system across the world, and threatens to continue to challenge society for the coming months and years. More than 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than 60,000 Americans have lost their lives as of the writing of this proposal. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a wearable physiological sensing solution for COVID-19 patient management, including diagnosis, triage, and monitoring of patients based on lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measures captured with the same device. The central innovation lies in the hardware and algorithms that have been proposed for this purpose, building upon the team’s prior work in other areas of wearable bio-acoustic sensing and bioimpedance spectroscopy. The following two specific aims are proposed for the research: (1) to design, implement, and validate a wearable sensing system for lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measurements; and (2) to test and evaluate this system to assess efficacy and potential information derived in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and persons under investigation for COVID-19 longitudinally. Successful completion of this project would result in a validated prototype for sensing multiple parameters of cardiopulmonary health in patients with COVID-19, with imminent feasibility to transition the technology to commercialization and through regulatory pathways. This would provide a much-needed patient management technology for this novel coronavirus to healthcare practitioners and ultimately a means to monitor patients remotely to ensure that any deterioration in health is detected as early as possible. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the US and the rest of the world in an unparalleled manner, taking nearly 60,000 lives in the US alone over the past two months and afflicting more than a million Americans, with costs to society that are difficult to measure or bear. Technologies for improving the management of patients presenting at the emergency room are urgently needed in this era, specifically for determining whether such patients should be cared for in the intensive care unit, via infectious diseases procedures, or otherwise. We propose to design a wearable system for measuring lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and movement in the same device to address these critical needs.","Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19",10163297,R01EB023808,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Auscultation ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Body Temperature ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Emergency Medical Technicians ', ' Emergency Medicine Technicians ', ' Emergency Paramedics ', ' emergency medical personnel ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Injuries ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Sounds ', ' Breathing Sounds ', ' Lung Sounds ', ' Rest ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Skin Temperature ', ' Societies ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Respiratory distress ', ' respiratory ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' Juvenile Chronic Arthritis ', ' Juvenile Chronic Polyarthritis ', ' Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' juvenile arthritis ', ' juvenile idiopathic arthritis ', ' Chronic Childhood Arthritis ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' synergism ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Deterioration ', ' miniaturize ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' Data Analytics ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' CoV emergence ', ' coronavirus emergence ', ' emergent CoV ', ' emergent coronavirus ', ' emerging CoV ', ' emerging coronavirus ', ' nCoV ', ' new CoV ', ' new coronavirus ', ' novel CoV ', ' novel coronavirus ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,396542,GA-05,0.07512360222657022
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer.

"The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen- induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury (bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease. Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host- derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia. This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies, yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and severe lung disease. We have recently discovered that the lung microbiome - the communities of microbes living in the respiratory tract - are altered by inhaled oxygen and necessary for the development of oxygen-induced lung injury.

"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9934164,U01CA216459,"['Anxiety ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Judgment ', ' Lobectomy ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nodule ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Lung nodule ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' CXR ', ' chest X ray ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest radiography ', ' lung radiography ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' thorax radiography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Decision Aid ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Solid ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Indolent ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' radiologist ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' Descriptor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' attenuation ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Property ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Screening Result ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Patient risk ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' unnecessary treatment ', ' radiomics ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinically translatable ', ' screening program ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' CT screening ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' pathology imaging ', ' automated image analysis ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' low dose computerized tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,461573,MI-12,0.2711463039459855
"Development of a Rapid Method for Imaging Regional Ventilation in Small Animals w/o Contrast Agents The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models. It will provide spatially- and temporally- resolved information regarding lung ventilation that will be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases.",Development of a Rapid Method for Imaging Regional Ventilation in Small Animals w/o Contrast Agents,9888370,R01EB023045,"['Air ', ' Animals ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Communities ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Compliance ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Plethysmography ', ' pressure ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' lung function ', ' respiratory function ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung scanning ', ' lung imaging ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' lung volume ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' lung pressure ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Radiation ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' drug discovery ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' in vivo ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' X-ray microtomography ', ' Xray microtomography ', ' micro CT ', ' micro computed tomography ', ' microtomography ', ' microCT ', ' animal imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' technical certificate ', ' Technical Degree ', ' efficacy study ', ' parametric imaging ', ' in vivo monitoring ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' ventilation ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,419843,IL-13,0.1873580113162842
"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules.

"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,9927683,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Endothelium ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genotype ', ' Histology ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Pulmonary Fibrosis ', ' lung fibrosis ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translating ', ' improved ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' Genetic ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' c new ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Computed Tomography Scanners ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' X-ray microtomography ', ' Xray microtomography ', ' micro CT ', ' micro computed tomography ', ' microtomography ', ' microCT ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' symptomatology ', ' recruit ', ' CT screening ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,725923,NY-13,0.029005758414394647
"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV- infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania, which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2) investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3) determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale- up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and care in terms of improving imaging, pathology, radiology and tissue acquisition and clinical care of lung cancer 5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research network, clinical expertise for sample acquisition and care, improved pathology and radiology diagnostics services, a lung cancer screening program, and a large biorepository that should support lung cancer research in the region for many years to come. We propose to study lung cancer in Uganda and Tanzania and the relationship to HIV-1 infection through three project-based and three cores. The results of these studies of the epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging of lung cancer and the relationship to HIV infection will lead to technological transfer of instrumentation to characterize lung cancer and artificial intelligence algorithms to aid in discerning pulmonary granulomatous disease from lung cancer on radiological imaging. Findings herein may lead to the development of country-specific guidelines in the evaluation and management of lung cancer.","Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging",10084623,U54CA254566,"['Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tanzania ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Uganda ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Lung Capacity ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung scanning ', ' lung imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Granulomatous ', ' Country ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' clinical care ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' actionable variants ', ' actionable mutation ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' radiological imaging ', ' screening program ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,1024684,OH-11,0.2579201489055567
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Genetic interaction analysis involving oncogenesis-related genes in lung cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  The development of cancer diseases is driven by the accumulation of many oncogenesis-related genetic alterations and tumorigenesis is triggered by complex networks of involved genes rather than independent actions. The interactions among genetic factors are believed to play important roles in carcinogenesis and contribute to the missing heritability. In this proposal, we designed a filtered gene-gene interaction analysis aiming to identify the epistasis involving important oncogenesis-related genes. Besides the advantage of dimensional reduction and increased power, this filtered interaction analysis will help us identify novel oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes implicated in lung cancer development that will not be revealed in main effect association analysis. It will also identify novel susceptibility variants, including those in intergenic and non-coding regions, affecting lung cancer risk by interacting/modulating with oncogenesis-related genes. Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease and researchers have identified vast differences in genomic attributes. However, the knowledge about epistatic features in lung cancer subtypes is limited. We will conduct a stratified epistasis analysis by lung cancer histology subtype in the proposed study to reveal subtype-specific genetic interactions and gene networks. The stratified analysis by histology will enhance our understanding about this complicated disease mechanism in lung cancer and has the potential to contribute to precision medicine in lung cancer treatment.  A main challenge in genetic association studies is to understand the functional consequences of identified genetic variants. In this study, we proposed functional annotation analysis including eQTL gene expression analysis, pathway and gene network analysis, and functional annotation of epistasis-involved SNPs. This integrative epistasis and functional annotation analysis will help us pinpoint the causal epistasis and characterize the epistasis-involved genes or regions in lung cancer risk development. It will be a pilot study to explore how the regulatory non-coding variants impact lung cancer risk by interacting with oncogenesis-related genes.  The proposed study will provide insights about the complicated biological interactions that are critical for gene regulation, biochemical networks, and developmental pathways implicated in lung carcinogenesis. In order to finish the proposed study, we collected the genotype data from three independent GWAS studies including 24,037 lung cancer patients and 20,401 healthy controls from the Caucasian population. The genotype and gene expression data in lung tissues from 409 individuals will be applied for eQTL gene expression analysis.

"Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF. This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study (R01HL134851). With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr. Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an increasingly prevalent chronic lung disease with no available cure; frailty affects 50% of IPF patients, and is associated with increased severity of illness in response to acute insults, which are the most common cause of death in IPF. We identified that visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for frailty and propose to investigate potential mechanisms linking visceral adipose tissue and frailty, as modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in this growing patient population. Our findings may lead to novel therapies and clinical trials evaluating the role of existing medications in the prevention and treatment of frailty in IPF.",Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty
