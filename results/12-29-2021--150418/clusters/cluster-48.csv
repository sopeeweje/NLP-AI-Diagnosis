"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.           Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.

"Functional Classification of Cardiomyocytes Derived from Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States each year for both women and men. Although significant advances have been made in conventional drug and device therapies in recent years, they have not been able to reverse the loss of functional myocardium. Regeneration of the heart may someday be possible with the ability to derive functional cardiomyocytes from human stem cells. However, before these cells can be used for cardiac repair, more must be known about their electrophysiology and their likelihood to seamlessly integrate with native cardiac tissue. In particular, it is of critical importance to establish the electrophysiological compatibility of these cells with host myocardium to minimize the risk of arrhythmia.

The overall goal of this project is to develop a new, analytical and automated method to classify newly differentiated cardiac cells, based on techniques developed for machine learning. The specific aims are first, to use optical mapping and microelectrode recordings to generate datasets of functional electrophysiological characteristics of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs), and second, to use machine learning techniques to classify the phenotypes of the hESC-CMs, based on parametric descriptions.

Cells at different stages of differentiation will be evaluated at different pacing and pharmacological conditions that will help to establish the functional properties of the cells.  In summary, the proposed research will enable the classification of cardiomyocytes that are derived from human stem cells.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition to developing these tools, we also propose the creation of a large public database that can help other researchers with an interest in predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation.",Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation,8242479,R21LM011026,"['beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders ', ' beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents ', ' beta blocker ', ' Adrenergic beta-Blockers ', ' Adrenergic beta-Antagonists ', ' Affect ', ' Methanone, (2-butyl-3-benzofuranyl)(4-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)-3,5-diiodophenyl)- ', ' Amiodarone ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' Deceleration ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Heart ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Bradycardia ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Event ', ' prophylactic ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' valve replacement ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Myocardial ', ' Metadata ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' sharing data ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2012,213554,MI-12,0.09467527223669711

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition to developing these tools, we also propose the creation of a large public database that can help other researchers with an interest in predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation.",Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation,8484439,R21LM011026,"['beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders ', ' beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents ', ' beta blocker ', ' Adrenergic beta-Blockers ', ' Adrenergic beta-Antagonists ', ' Affect ', ' Methanone, (2-butyl-3-benzofuranyl)(4-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)-3,5-diiodophenyl)- ', ' Amiodarone ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' Deceleration ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Heart ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Bradycardia ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Event ', ' prophylactic ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' valve replacement ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Myocardial ', ' Metadata ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' sharing data ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2013,152303,MI-12,0.09467527223669711
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8421618,R01HL116832,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Direct Costs ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2013,557031,CA-12,0.0509007785407475
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic.

"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Vascular-Assist Devices ', ' Heart-Assist Pumps ', ' Cardiac-Assist Pumps ', ' Heart-Assist Devices ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Businesses ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' satisfaction ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Metric ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' ventricular assist device ', ' Health system ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' implantation ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,PA-18,0.08504943645903264
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Critical Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Nomascus ', ' Hylobates ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Sciences ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Intensive Care ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,IL-01,0.06123599591931185
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,R01HL106545,"['angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Angiography ', ' Arteries ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Catheters ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' density ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Calcified ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Modality ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' response ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Coronary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Rupture ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment response ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' computer aided detection ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,MI-12,0.07775534126706309
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Myocardium ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' tomography ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Medical Imaging, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Photons ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Patient Selection ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Scanning ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Stress Tests ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,CA-28,0.08044038446685356
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8725658,K25DK097279,"['Accounting ', ' Advertising ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' hemodynamics ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Infection ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' M.P.H.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.            ",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8674683,R01HL122484,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Heart ', ' Insertion of catheter into heart chamber ', ' Heart Catheterization Pocedure ', ' Heart Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization Procedures ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Image Reconstructions ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' wave (radiation) ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Radiation Protection ', ' Recommendation ', ' Societies ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stress ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Medical Imaging, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Appearance ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Radioactive ', ' Reader ', ' Sum ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,782871,IL-01,0.05935941233084537
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8652345,R01HL116832,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Direct Costs ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2014,527741,CA-12,0.0509007785407475
"Improving Heart Transplant Allocation to Reduce High Waitlist Mortality in Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding why women awaiting heart transplantation have a higher mortality rate than men. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing and candidacy for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve healthcare and reduce heart transplant waitlist mortality. The objective of this research application is to use a contemporary cohort to evaluate sex differences in heart transplant waitlist mortality and create a survival model that better predicts need for advanced heart failure therapy. The central hypothesis is that sex differences in heart failure mortality among patients awaiting transplantation are due to sex differences in prognostic risk factors. The rationale for the proposed research is that sex differences in prognostic risk factors have been identified in other heart failure cohorts and creation of risk prediction models has successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify sex-specific risk factors for survival in heart failure patients awaitng heart transplantation and changes in risk factors over time using the national registry (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, SRTR), 2) to develop a survival model for patients awaiting heart transplant using the SRTR database, and 3) to validate that the survival model improves prediction of mortality for the general population of patients awaiting transplantation. The approach is innovative because it challenges and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account the differences between women and men to create a heart failure survival model that will lay the foundation to change a ""rule based"" hear transplant allocation system to a state of the art ""survival model based"" system. The survival model will be created with innovative machine learning statistical methods that do not require advance knowledge of interactions between variables or the parametric relation of variables (linearity or non-linearity) to patient survival. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored sex differences in prognostic risk         factors despite known sex differences in heart failure survival. Furthermore, by creating the first heart failure survival model that includes sex specific risk factors and modern medical/device therapy with adequate representation of women and men we will be significantly advancing the heart failure field. This model, which is derived from our national transplant registry, will improe survival prediction for advanced heart failure patients and can be used to inform and enhance organ allocation policy in the United States. Clinical heart failure studies can also be designed i the future to include women with similar risk of mortality to men in order to improve treatment for both sexes. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because women have a higher mortality rate than men while awaiting heart transplantation and the factors contributing to this disparity have not been identified. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission to better characterize patients with advanced heart failure and improve health care for both genders.",Improving Heart Transplant Allocation to Reduce High Waitlist Mortality in Women,9125416,R56HL125420,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' heart transplant ', ' cardiac graft ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Medical Device ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Mycocardium Disease ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' Systolic heart failure ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' working group ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' time use ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transplant registry ', ' clinical practice ', ' candidate selection ', ' organ allocation ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R56,2015,285869,OH-11,0.1359882541047281
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9063822,R01GM104412,"['Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cilia ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Heart ', ' heart defect ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Polynesian bronchiectasis ', ' Kartagener Triad ', ' Kartagener Syndrome ', ' Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias ', ' Laterality ', ' Handedness ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motion ', ' mucous ', ' Mucus ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Visual Pattern Recognition ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' visceral transposition ', ' visceral heterotaxy ', ' transposition of viscera ', ' situs inversus viscerum ', ' situs abnormality ', ' laterality sequence ', ' inversion of viscera ', ' heterotaxy ', ' heterotaxia syndrome ', ' Situs Inversus ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Organ ', ' Left ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Respiratory Epithelium ', ' Structure of respiratory epithelium ', ' insight ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' With laterality ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' respiratory ', ' innovative technologies ', ' mutant ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' cilium motility ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Defect ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Outcome ', ' founder mutation ', ' airway epithelium ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' mouse model ', ' public health relevance ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,96059,PA-18,0.03673876509097064
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,8916145,R01GM104412,"['Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cilia ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Heart ', ' heart defect ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Polynesian bronchiectasis ', ' Kartagener Triad ', ' Kartagener Syndrome ', ' Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias ', ' Laterality ', ' Handedness ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motion ', ' mucous ', ' Mucus ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Visual Pattern Recognition ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' visceral transposition ', ' visceral heterotaxy ', ' transposition of viscera ', ' situs inversus viscerum ', ' situs abnormality ', ' laterality sequence ', ' inversion of viscera ', ' heterotaxy ', ' heterotaxia syndrome ', ' Situs Inversus ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Organ ', ' Left ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Respiratory Epithelium ', ' Structure of respiratory epithelium ', ' insight ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' With laterality ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Visceral ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' respiratory ', ' innovative technologies ', ' mutant ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' cilium motility ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Defect ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Outcome ', ' founder mutation ', ' airway epithelium ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' mouse model ', ' public health relevance ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,560593,PA-18,0.03673876509097064
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Myocardium ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Photons ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Patient Selection ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Scanning ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Myocardial ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Stress Tests ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,CA-28,0.08044038446685356
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Algorithms ', ' Apgar Score ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Hospital Birthing Centers ', ' Hospital Birth Centers ', ' Delivery Rooms ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Fetal Heart ', ' fetus monitoring ', ' Fetal Monitoring ', ' Fetus ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Fetal Heart Rate ', ' Intraobserver Variations ', ' Intra-Observer Variation ', ' Intra-Observer Variability ', ' Intraobserver Variability ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Umbilical Cord ', ' Umbilical cord structure ', ' Myometrial Contraction ', ' Uterine Contraction ', ' Work ', ' Litigation ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' theories ', ' Childbirth ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' stem ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,NY-01,0.04712822686973268
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8921191,K25DK097279,"['Accounting ', ' Advertising ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' hemodynamics ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Infection ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' M.P.H.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Critical Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Nomascus ', ' Hylobates ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Sciences ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Intensive Care ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,IL-01,0.06123599591931185
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8842707,R01HL122484,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Insertion of catheter into heart chamber ', ' Heart Catheterization Pocedure ', ' Heart Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization Procedures ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Image Reconstructions ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' wave (radiation) ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Radiation Protection ', ' Recommendation ', ' Societies ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stress ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Medical Imaging, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Appearance ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Radioactive ', ' Reader ', ' Sum ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' clinical practice ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,758935,IL-01,0.05935941233084537
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.            ",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,8875394,R01HL127661,"['circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' cardiovascular visualization ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' therapy outcome ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2015,634258,NJ-06,0.16052825928315123
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8824963,R01HL116832,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Direct Costs ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2015,461213,CA-12,0.0509007785407475
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9133363,K25DK097279,"['Accounting ', ' Advertising ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' hemodynamics ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Infection ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' M.P.H.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Pericardium ', ' Pericardial sac structure ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Trees ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Death, Sudden, Cardiac ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Cardiac Death ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Visceral ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNFA ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Cachectin ', ' TNF gene ', ' Early identification ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Institution ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reader ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Process ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' prognostic value ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Algorithms ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' indexing ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1β ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Language ', ' Lipids ', ' Manuals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,CA-28,0.17086972371974954
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9202845,R44HL125001,"['Algorithms ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' Boston ', ' California ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implantable device ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' physician office visit ', ' Office Visits ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetries ', ' Telemetry ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Single-blind ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' Funding ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' prototype ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' heart rate variability ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' cloud based ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' treatment group ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' Cloud Service ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2016,1009410,CA-12,0.13608259133818645
"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad.

"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Critical Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Nomascus ', ' Hylobates ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' mortality ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Sciences ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Intensive Care ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Patient risk ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,IL-01,0.06123599591931185
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9115219,R01HL127028,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age

"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Algorithms ', ' Apgar Score ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cesarean ', ' C section ', ' Abdominal Delivery ', ' Cesarean section ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Hospital Birthing Centers ', ' Hospital Birth Centers ', ' Delivery Rooms ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Fetal Heart ', ' fetus monitoring ', ' Fetal Monitoring ', ' Fetus ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Fetal Heart Rate ', ' Intraobserver Variations ', ' Intra-Observer Variation ', ' Intra-Observer Variability ', ' Intraobserver Variability ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Umbilical cord structure ', ' Umbilical Cord ', ' Uterine Contraction ', ' Myometrial Contraction ', ' Work ', ' Litigation ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' theories ', ' Childbirth ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' stem ', ' learning community ', ' heart rate monitor ', ' ']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,NY-01,0.04712822686973268
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cardiology ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Myocardium ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Photons ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Patient Selection ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Radiation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Myocardial ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Stress Tests ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,CA-28,0.08044038446685356
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9061011,R01HL122484,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Insertion of catheter into heart chamber ', ' Heart Catheterization Pocedure ', ' Heart Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization Procedures ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' image construction ', ' Image Reconstructions ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Radiation Protection ', ' Recommendation ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stress ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Appearance ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Radioactive ', ' Reader ', ' Sum ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' clinical practice ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' imaging agent ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,770494,IL-01,0.05935941233084537
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.        ",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9112221,R21AG051077,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Exercise Test ', ' Exercise stress test ', ' Exhibits ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitalization ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Myocardium ', ' Organelles ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Redox ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Protons ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical Function ', ' respiratory ', ' success ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' cost ', ' functional outcomes ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' rehabilitation management ', ' rehab management ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' long-term rehabilitation ', ' individual patient ', ' exercise intolerance ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,190640,NC-06,0.024563342520521534
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9324206,K25DK097279,"['Accounting ', ' Advertising ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' hemodynamics ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Infection ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Master of Public Health ', ' M.P.H.

"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cardiology ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Grant ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Industry ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mitral Valve ', ' Bicuspid Valve ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' tomography ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Coronary Angiography ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Collimator ', ' Collimation ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' Performance ', ' solid state ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Radiation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Myocardial ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Stress Tests ', ' Coupled ', ' computer generated ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,CA-28,0.08044038446685356
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9281894,R01HL127661,"['circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' cardiovascular visualization ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' cardiac resynchronization therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,593963,NJ-06,0.16052825928315123
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9314834,K24HL113128,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Cardiology ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Charge ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' indexing ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' repository ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24) ', ' K24 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Coronary ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' markov model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' high risk ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' training opportunity ', ' radiomics ', ' Risk stratification ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2017,121969,MA-08,0.06463756041875578
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9313715,R01HL127028,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', '

"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9335418,R44HL125001,"['Algorithms ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' Boston ', ' California ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' implantable device ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Single-blind ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' Funding ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' monitoring device ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Devices ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' prototype ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' heart rate variability ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' cloud based ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' treatment group ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' Cloud Service ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,490059,CA-12,0.13608259133818645
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9382827,R01HL135557,"['Myocardial ', ' Cardiac

"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact. The collaboration will establish a program for large-scale translational research in HIV and heart failure by developing a shared research platform between two major research institutions in the Bronx and Chicago. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure imposes one of the highest disease burdens of any condition in the U.S., with over 6 million Americans affected, and costs reaching $34 billion annually. The extent to which it affects people living with HIV is currently unclear but of critical importance, due to the aging of the population as a result of successful antiretroviral therapy. Our work will allow for the prediction of heart failure risk in people living with HIV and identify unique heart failure phenotypes in the context of HIV infection, both of which may help to tailor prevention and treatment efforts in the future in this vulnerable population.",Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals,9348984,K01HL137557,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', '

"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9198041,K08HL121080,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Critical Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Trees ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Nomascus ', ' Hylobates ', ' Gibbons ', ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Sciences ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency research ', ' Emergency care research ', ' Patient risk ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2017,163944,IL-01,0.06123599591931185
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9365658,R01HS025402,[''],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2017,400000,AZ-06,0.09560781198285526
"Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA Abstract Kaufman: Air pollution, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation burden in MESA This proposal examines the impact of ambient air pollutants on the development, burden, and triggering of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Air pollutants, especially particulate matter, have been associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease and stroke. The incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke is declining due to prevention efforts, while development of heart failure (HF, especially with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and atrial arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation, AF) are becoming more important components of the burden of cardiovascular disease; the role of environmental factors in these two frequently co-existing conditions diseases is largely unstudied. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an extraordinarily valuable cohort for understanding predictors and correlates of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to participants’ ages, extensive existing phenotyping, and planned assessment in an examination beginning in 2016. In addition, MESA has become the most carefully studied cohort in terms of exposure to ambient air pollutants. This proposed study will extend the air pollutant characterization using innovative low-cost indoor and outdoor home-based monitoring and state-of-the-art modeling approaches incorporating extensive geographic inputs. We will characterize both the relationship between long-term ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO), and development of early stage heart failure and atrial arrhythmias, and the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollutants and triggering of atrial arrhythmias and AF burden. It is important to understand these relationships since: 1) Air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular mortality; 2) HF and structural disease correlates of HF are risk factors for AF; and 3) HFpEF with AF represents a group at especially high mortality risk. We will estimate long-term (annual average) and short-term (hourly and daily) concentrations of PM2.5, NOX, NO2, O3, and CO, outside and inside all MESA participants’ homes using state-of-the-art monitoring technology and spatiotemporal statistical models. We will use novel low-cost pollutant monitoring sensors at a subset of MESA participant homes and community locations. Early evidence of prevalent HF subtypes and newly emerging sub-phenotypes will be assessed using information from in-exam echocardiographic cardiac parameters, 6-minute walk test results, arterial tonometry, and biomarkers (NTproBNP, sST2, galectin-3). Ambulatory novel two-week ECG monitoring and interrogations of implanted pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators will allow us to assess the association between long-term air pollution exposure and AF and short-term air pollution and the triggering of atrial arrhythmias. Through this effort, we will gain unprecedented insight into the role of air pollutants in development of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on HF, especially HFpEF, and on AF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasingly important health problems as our population ages. Air pollution exposures have been linked to both HF and AF, but many questions remain about the relationships, and new technologies are available to study this. By understanding the relationship between short- and long-term air pollution exposures and the development of HF and triggering and burden of AF, we can gain critical information to help protect public health, reduce health inequality, and inform air quality regulatory policy.","Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA",9386363,R56ES026528,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', '

"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9267094,R21AG051077,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Exercise Test ', ' Exercise stress test ', ' Exhibits ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitalization ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Myocardium ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Organelles ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Redox ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Protons ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical Function ', ' respiratory ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' cost ', ' functional outcomes ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' rehabilitation management ', ' rehab management ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' long-term rehabilitation ', ' individual patient ', ' exercise intolerance ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,229328,NC-06,0.024563342520521534
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Heart ', ' Insertion of catheter into heart chamber ', ' Heart Catheterization Pocedure ', ' Heart Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization Procedures ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation Protection ', ' Recommendation ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Dimensions ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Appearance ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Radioactive ', ' Reader ', ' Sum ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' imaging agent ', ' individual patient ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' 3D ultrasound ', ' clinical imaging ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging approach ', ' ']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,IL-01,0.05935941233084537
"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Cardiomyopathy familial hypertrophic ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Two-Dimensional Echocardiography ', ' 2D Echocardiography ', ' 2-D Echocardiography ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardium ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reading ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' heart hypertension ', ' heart disorder hypertension ', ' heart disease hypertension ', ' cardiac hypertension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' interest ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' myocardium disease ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' patient registry ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,CA-12,0.12339185189243292
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9475862,R01HL127661,"['Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' function of the heart ', ' cardiac function ', ' heart function ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanical model ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' cardiac resynchronization therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,589455,NJ-06,0.16052825928315123
"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Freezing ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Coronary Angiography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' respiratory ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' prospective ', ' data acquisition ', ' volunteer ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' artificial neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,OH-03,0.047990679059803525
"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"Prediction of short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, although mortality from CHD has declined over recent decades, the incidence of CHD has remained high. This year, nearly 600,000 Americans will experience their first myocardial infarction (MI) and a larger number will have undiagnosed ischemia. Both groups are at risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), which compounds the burden of morbidity and mortality they face. Efforts to prevent CHD and its complications like ICM have been hampered by poor patient adherence, which is in large part due to misperceptions of risk. Patients are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors if they know their risk of disease, particularly if their risk is imminent. However, although several models estimate long-term risk of CHD over the next 10 years, there are no established models for predicting short-term risk of CHD within a one year time frame. Likewise, among patients with CHD, there are no existing models to assess the overall risk of coexisting ICM. To address these knowledge gaps in the field, I will build robust prediction models by applying the latest machine learning algorithms to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and the Veterans Affairs (VA) cohorts.  In Aim 1, I will examine the 477,000 UK Biobank participants without preexisting CHD to develop a prediction model for one-year risk of new onset CHD. I will use several different machine learning algorithms, compare their respective predictive performances, and select the best-performing and most clinically applicable model. I will also compare the risk classification ability of this new model with existing long-term risk prediction models such as the Framingham and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk scores.  In Aim 2, I will apply machine learning techniques to a large VA patient cohort consisting of over 300,000 patients with known coronary anatomy and left ventricular systolic function to develop a prediction model for the presence of ICM. In light of the two primary mechanisms for ischemic cardiomyopathy, irreversible myocyte loss from MI and hibernating myocardium from chronic ischemia, I will perform a stratified analysis by history of prior MI to determine if the risk factors for ICM vary depending on whether the pathological mechanism is infarction versus ischemia.  An improved understanding of the predictors of CHD and ICM will lead to insights into the biological basis of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, accurate identification of individuals who are at imminent risk for CHD and its complication, ICM, is of central importance to efforts in preventing cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary heart disease and its complications such as ischemic cardiomyopathy are the global leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and an improved ability to assess risk along this continuum of ischemic heart disease is urgently needed. I will apply the latest machine learning techniques to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and VA cohorts to develop robust prediction models for short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging

"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

"Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF The goal of this proposal is to develop accurate, generalizable and interpretable predictive models based on electronic health records (EHR) that detect heart failure (HF) in primary care patients one to two years before a clinical diagnosis and to translate the models for use in clinical care. Case-control datasets from two large US health systems (i.e., >13,000 incident HF cases and >120,000 controls) will be created and used to address two of the three study aims. For Aim 1 (Improve prediction of pre-diagnostic HF and model generalizability), recursive neural network (RNN) models will be used to improve prediction accuracy when compared to prior work that was based on traditional machine learning models (e.g., random forest, lasso logistic regression). It is expected that RNN models will perform better because temporality of EHR events can be captured. Aim 1 will also focus on improving model generalizability (i.e., among patients within and across health systems) by leveraging RNN models and by addressing challenges caused by variation in patient level EHR data (e.g., density of data) that are independent of a patient's actual health status. Aim 2 (Identify and clinically validate pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes) will focus on the identification of pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes and the use of content from RNN models derived under Aim 1. Three levels of analysis will be completed. First, we will focus on pathophysiologic heterogeneity that is represented, in part, by HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). But, HFpEF is considered to be more heterogeneous than HFrEF. New methods will be developed to reliably identify pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes. Second, phenotypes will be clinically validated for reliability and coherence and compared to clinical judgement based on a review of the patient's record. Third, we will address a challenge with RNN models, as they generate “black box” solutions that are seemingly uninterpretable. We propose to develop new methods to extract and represent the content from RNN models. We hypothesize that when phenotype status is combined with information extracted from Aim 1 RNN models it will be judged by expert clinician reviews to be superior for prevention care to phenotype status when it is combined with information extracted from traditional machine learning models or to a direct review of the patient's EHR. Finally, we will prospectively validate the phenotype and RNN models using a large primary care cohort being created by Sutter and related serial biobanked blood samples. For aim 3 we will determine how accurately the models predict elevated biomarker levels that are known to be sensitive and specific indicators of HF disease progression.   The proposed research will contribute valuable knowledge that will assist doctors to identify patients who are at high-risk of incident heart failure 12 to 24 months before the actual diagnosis and that exceed what is possible when relying on traditional signs, symptoms or risk factors. Doctors will be able to provide a more targeted approach to reduce the future risk of heart failure and the risks of morbidity and accelerated mortality that high risk patients face. Moreover, the methods that are developed for the early detection of heart failure in this study will help other researchers in creating more accurate and generalizable predictive models when using electronic health records data and when applying these models for use in clinical care.  ",Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF,9779100,R56HL116832,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Troponin T ', ' tropomyosin binding protein troponin T ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Disease Progression ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' EFRAC ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' Myocytes ', ' cohort ', ' Stretching ', ' expectation ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' case control ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Cardiac ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' feeding ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Patient risk ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' recursive neural network ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' ']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R56,2018,761303,CA-12,0.08204874342696541
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9505972,R01HL127028,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Heart ', ' Cardiac Catheterization Procedures ', ' Insertion of catheter into heart chamber ', ' Heart Catheterization Procedure ', ' Heart Catheterization ', ' Cardiac Catheterization ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation Protection ', ' Recommendation ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Dimensions ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Appearance ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Radioactive ', ' Reader ', ' Sum ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' cardiac SPECT ', ' cardiac single photon emission computed tomography ', ' imaging agent ', ' individual patient ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' 3D ultrasound ', ' clinical imaging ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging approach ', ' ']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,IL-01,0.05935941233084537
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9393346,K08HL121080,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hylobates Genus ', ' Symphalangus ', ' Nomascus ', ' Hylobates ', ' Gibbons ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Sciences ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' ward ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Emergency care research ', ' Emergency research ', ' Patient risk ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2018,163944,IL-01,0.06123599591931185
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9452770,K23HL135274,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Investments ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' preempt ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' digital ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Theory of Change ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' big biomedical data ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,203540,CA-12,0.1460079250374683
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9519828,R01HS025402,[''],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2018,392266,AZ-06,0.09560781198285526
"Single cell molecular network mechanisms of cardiotoxicity induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors As the number of cancer patients with stable disease increases, the long-term cardiotoxic effects of treatment with anti-cancer drugs become increasingly apparent. Cardiovascular-related mortality is 7-fold higher in childhood cancer survivors than expected from an age matched normal population and ~12% of breast cancer survivors suffer heart failure within three years of treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are exemplars of promising anti-cancer drugs whose use is complicated by cardiotoxicity. Whether this reflects drug-mediated inhibition of the same signaling pathways as the anti-oncogenic effects of these drugs is unclear. Cardiotoxic phenotypes induced by chemically diverse TKIs include life-threatening heart failure and cardiac infarction, and are likely to include targets that are not the nominal ones; this is particularly true of poly- selective TKIs. Identifying the precise mechanisms of TKI-mediated cardiotoxicity has the potential to substantially improve cancer care and also reveal fundamental aspects of cardiac cell biology.  My project exploits the recent development of reproducible means to transdifferentiate human induced pluripotent stem cell into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and probe the biology of these cells using omic and “systems biology” methods. I have collected extensive preliminary data on hiPSC-CMs responses to over 50 different drug perturbations and am in the midst of using statistical regression and machine learning algorithms to define and study the molecular networks associated with TKI-induced cardiotoxicity. I have already found that cardiac energy metabolism is dysregulated by many cardiotoxic drugs and could be biomarker of cardiotoxicity more broadly. In this proposal, I will build on my profiling data through focused study of Sorafenib, a drug that I have shown to increase anaerobic glycolysis in hiPSC-CMs. As a multi-target drug, Sorafenib inhibits multiple kinases and gene networks. Identifying targets relevant to cardiotoxicity is a key goal of my research. I will tackle this by establishing the sequential onset of molecular networks after drug treatment and their causal relation with the increased glycolysis phenotype. Single cell heterogeneous molecular responses will be analyzed to find non-genetic mechanisms that determine the differential sensitivity of cardiotoxicity to Sorafenib. I will build quantitative models to fit and explain data at population and single cell levels. Ultimately, to find means to increase therapeutic effects, I want to systematically compare target expression, phenotypic responses and molecular mechanisms induced by Sorafenib in both hiPSC-CMs and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (treated by Sorafenib clinically). My study will generate pilot methods in converting “big data” into mechanistic insights in cardiac biology, and facilitate development of new therapies to mitigate cardiotoxicity without compromising efficacy of cancer elimination. PROJECT NARRATIVE The use of many cancer drugs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, is complicated by cardiotoxicity, which can be debilitating and life-threating but is poorly understood. My research aims to understand the molecular changes associated with drug-induced cardiotoxicity as a means to screen for adverse effects in new drug, identify patients who are particularly susceptible to heart damage and develop strategies for mitigating such toxicity.",Single cell molecular network mechanisms of cardiotoxicity induced by tyrosine kinase

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time.

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9539728,R01HL135557,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy

"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact. The collaboration will establish a program for large-scale translational research in HIV and heart failure by developing a shared research platform between two major research institutions in the Bronx and Chicago. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure imposes one of the highest disease burdens of any condition in the U.S., with over 6 million Americans affected, and costs reaching $34 billion annually. The extent to which it affects people living with HIV is currently unclear but of critical importance, due to the aging of the population as a result of successful antiretroviral therapy. Our work will allow for the prediction of heart failure risk in people living with HIV and identify unique heart failure phenotypes in the context of HIV infection, both of which may help to tailor prevention and treatment efforts in the future in this vulnerable population.",Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals,9463657,K01HL137557,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', '

"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9625645,K23HL135274,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Investments ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Administration ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' preempt ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Theory of Change ', ' Data Science ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,203257,CA-12,0.1460079250374683
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9664901,K08HL141598,"['Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Consultations ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Hospital Departments ', ' Information Theory ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Probability ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Weight ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' functional status ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test ', ' nuclear stress test ', ' cardiac stress test ', ' Stress Thallium Test ', ' Exercise Thallium ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Perioperative ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' treatment center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' risk mitigation ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep learning ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' perioperative mortality ', ' perioperative death ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2019,161047,OH-11,0.05338153841869206
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9815239,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' heart transplant ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' cardiac graft ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' United States ', ' Ventricular Function ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Refractory Disease ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Data Science ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disabling symptom ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,598123,MN-01,0.1435954685635016
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Fibrosis ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Blood flow ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' respiratory ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' magnetic field ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' magnetohydrodynamic ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,CA-28,0.011369861672172087
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9755492,R01HL135557,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy

"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9737693,R01HL141989,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Ventricular Fibrillation ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' heart electrical activity ', ' cardiac electrical activity ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' functional genomics ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques ', ' cardiac electrophysiology ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Molecular ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' endophenotype ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' TOPMed ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' causal variant ', ' causative variant ', ' causative mutation ', ' causal mutation ', ' causal gene ', ' causal allele ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,490901,WA-07,0.09725477435344271
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice.

"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and

"Dementia and Heart Failure in the Community In response to PA-17-089, we propose exploratory analyses with an existing epidemiologic heart failure (HF) cohort linked to electronic health record (EHR) data to address the combined burden of coexisting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and HF. We will capitalize on the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) and apply novel data science methods to existing community datasets. Recent adverse trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are due to a major increase in HF deaths, and the uncontrolled epidemic of HF compromises progress against CVD. Addressing the epidemic of HF, a disease of aging populations, requires understanding how coexisting conditions interact with HF to impact outcomes and health care utilization. AD/ADRD occupies a distinct position within coexisting conditions as HF increases the risk of AD/ADRD, in part, via shared pathways. However, this association and, in particular, which phenotype of the heterogeneous HF syndrome is associated with AD/ADRD is not well known. AD/ADRD can adversely impact the outcomes of HF, a serious chronic disease that requires effective self-management and cognitive skills.  Yet, how AD/ADRD impacts health care utilization and outcomes in HF is not well understood. These knowledge gaps can be addressed by secondary analyses of existing data. Our objectives are to study, in an epidemiological cohort, the characteristics of HF that impart a higher risk of AD/ADRD, and the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes (death, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations and admission to skilled nursing facility). Our proposal directly addresses key points of the PA, such as “Effects of specific combinations of two or more comorbid conditions on risks for specific adverse health outcomes, impact of specific combinations of two or more chronic conditions, …interactions among disease processes, and health outcomes in complex older patients with multiple chronic conditions.” This work will capitalize on a large epidemiological HF cohort linked to comprehensive EHR data within the rich environment of the REP, optimally suited to our proposed secondary analyses. This proposal leverages the experience of our team with the epidemiology of HF and with novel data science methods readily applicable to secondary analyses of existing EHR data sets. Aim 1 will apply machine learning to discover HF phenotypes associated with AD/ADRD while considering cardiac function, occurrence of atrial fibrillation and other coexisting conditions. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes of HF. Conducting this work in a cohort within a geographically defined population and extensive longitudinal follow up will ensure that our results reflect the experience of community patients with HF. An improved understanding of the coexistence of AD/ADRD and HF will establish the prevalence of this association in the community and characterize the type of HF associated with AD/ADRD, which may allow earlier diagnosis, thereby enabling interventions to prevent or forestall early disease. Finally, improving our knowledge of how AD/ADRD affects outcomes will foster more precise management.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients. These studies hold potential for helping us understand and identify those patients at greatest risk of HRCP and subsequent heart attacks and death, and to evaluate the biological reasons that these patients develop HRCP.",Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque,9817023,R01HL146145,"['Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Arteries ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lipids ', ' Cardiovascular Models ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Individual ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Involuntary Muscle ', ' Smooth Muscle ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Coronary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' endoplasmic reticulum stress ', ' ER stress ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Risk stratification ', ' Inflammasome ', ' pain patient ', ' coronary plaque ', ' ']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1485906,NC-04,0.061270397214054896
"Real-Time Virtual Assessment of MitraClip Placement ABSTRACT Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over the age of 75 years in the US. Despite the prevalence of MR in the elderly population, however, almost half of patients identified with moderate- severe MR are turned down for traditional open-heart surgery due to co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach to treat MR by placement of MC in the center of the mitral valve (MV) to reduce MR. Despite the positive short-term outcomes of the MC procedure in reducing MR, the long-term outcome can be further improved if the effects of MC on both the fluid and solid mechanics of the MV and left ventricle (LV) were available at the time the clip is placed. Recently, we developed a physics-based human cardiac function simulator for the optimal design of a novel annuloplasty ring with a sub-MV element for correction of MR, as well as physics-based simulations of MC placement. The problem with these simulations, as far as clinical applications is concerned, is they are extremely time consuming (3 days to complete simulations on 96-processor cluster). One way to make these time consuming simulations clinically applicable is to run them in advance for a wide range of patient characteristics (e.g., degree of MR, size and shape of the MV and LV, etc.) and MC placements. Currently, when clinicians are ready to place the MC on the MV, they have at their fingertips real-time data on degree of MR, and size and shape of the MV and LV measured using 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). We propose the development and validation of a searchable virtual patient atlas (SVPA) that will provide the clinician with detailed predictions of patient outcomes in real time that are based on MC placement and the RT3D-TEE patient-specific data. The first 50 models in our SVPA will be created from existing RT3D-TEE datasets provided by National Heart Centre Singapore, NHCS. Then, we will use our novel-shape dictionary learning models to automatically generate 150 additional models for our SVPA. Machine learning models will be trained with the simulation data in order to create machine learning-FE (ML-FE) surrogates that can predict FE outputs directly from the model geometry. This would enable real-time prediction of patient-specific MC device outcomes. Our preliminary studies using 3D heart simulations clearly show that the main advantage with the ML model over the 3D FE model is speed (i.e., ML runs in 1 CPU second versus 3D FE model runs in 1100 CPU hours!). We will validate the outcome predictions of our SVPA using an additional 50 existing RT3D-TEE datasets with known MC patient outcomes provided by NHCS. After the outcome prediction using SVPA for each case, we will use the dataset and the measured outcome to train the original SVPA further and validate a new dataset with the original and the updated SVPA. We will select the more accurate SVPA (the original or the updated) to determine possible correlations between the primary geometrical parameters and other patient overall biometric information with the MR and optimal MC placement.

"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,9809933,R21EB028486,"['novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' treatment compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient cooperation ', ' patient adherence ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' operation ', ' Cardiac rehabilitation ', ' cardiac rehab ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' rate of change ', ' heart rate monitor ', ' exercise capacity ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Exercise ', ' Exertion ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Failure ', ' heart function ', ' function of the heart ', ' cardiac function ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' EFRAC ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Proxy ', ' ']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2019,208632,TX-17,0.014043854766508702
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Cardiomyopathy familial hypertrophic ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' 2D Echocardiography ', ' 2-D Echocardiography ', ' Two-Dimensional Echocardiography ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' heart muscle ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' Myocardium ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reading ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' interest ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' heart imaging ', ' heart scanning ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' myocardium disease ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' patient registry ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' clinical imaging ', ' automated image analysis ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,MA-07,0.12339185189243292
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9801981,R01HL148248,"['Individual ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' heart disease risk ', ' Address ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' clinical conference ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' experience ', ' prevent ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Knowledge ', ' Intervention ', ' open source ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' high risk ', ' Source Code ', ' Death ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial bias ', ' ethnic bias ', ' Manuals ', ' minority communities ', ' Time ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Healthcare ', ' clinical risk ', ' negative affect ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Population ', ' ages ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' health data ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' circulatory system ', ' stroke model ', ' stroke risk ', ' thromboembolic stroke ', ' flexibility ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' learning strategy ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Image ', ' predictive modeling ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Technology ', ' Publications ', ' Affect ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' preventing ', ' disease risk ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Stroke ', ' Patients ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' United States ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Physicians ', ' Health ', ' Race ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' neural ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Vision ', ' Productivity ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Work ', ' Research ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Future ', ' Risk ', ' Caring ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Modern Man ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' kernel methods ', ' statistical learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' health care ', ' Prognosis ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Math ', ' Clinico-Pathologic Conference ', ' Clinico-Pathological Conference ', ' doubt ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' flexible ', ' developmental ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' imaging ', ' Neurological ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' designing ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' natural language understanding ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racially diverse ', ' race bias ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,709389,NY-12,-0.019609754286036736
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Freezing ', ' Gd element ', ' Gadolinium ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Coronary Angiography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' respiratory ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac motion ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' prospective ', ' data acquisition ', ' volunteer ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' ']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,OH-03,0.047990679059803525
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions.

"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9821943,K23HL145017,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Epidemic ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Flecainide ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Health ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating

"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact. The collaboration will establish a program for large-scale translational research in HIV and heart failure by developing a shared research platform between two major research institutions in the Bronx and Chicago. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure imposes one of the highest disease burdens of any condition in the U.S., with over 6 million Americans affected, and costs reaching $34 billion annually. The extent to which it affects people living with HIV is currently unclear but of critical importance, due to the aging of the population as a result of successful antiretroviral therapy. Our work will allow for the prediction of heart failure risk in people living with HIV and identify unique heart failure phenotypes in the context of HIV infection, both of which may help to tailor prevention and treatment efforts in the future in this vulnerable population.",Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals,9858825,K01HL137557,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', '

"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach  defined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for  torsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of  cardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced  arrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our  successful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently  published protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety  laboratories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9764845,R44HL139248,"['Michigan ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Ships ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Costs ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' heart preservation ', ' cardiac preservation ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' drug discovery ', ' heart cell ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' pre-clinical testing ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Slice ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Shipping ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupling ', ' experimental analysis ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' commercialization ', ' drug candidate ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' cardiac tissue engineering ', ' engineered heart tissue ', ' side effect ', ' safety assessment ', ' Action Potentials ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Drug Industry ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Exhibits ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Heart ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' ']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,881652,WI-02,0.11956849385116916
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' heart sonography ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Doppler Study ', ' Doppler Echocardiography ', ' Elements ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hyperemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Microcirculation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' pressure ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' heart function ', ' function of the heart ', ' cardiac function ', ' Blood flow ', ' diabetic ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' early onset ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' db/db mouse ', ' Diabetic mouse ', ' diabetes mouse model ', ' coronary perfusion ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' ']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,OH-03,0.07897135383258862
"The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease ABSTRACT Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals living with HIV experience an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although increased arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG-PET was shown to be associated with high risk plaque features (HRPFs) in those with HIV and subclinical atherosclerosis, there is no evidence of increased arterial inflammation in optimally treated HIV-infected adults with full viral suppression, low cardiovascular risk and no known CAD when the imaging results are compared to those from HIV- uninfected controls. These findings suggest that HIV-associated atherosclerosis may be triggered by factors other than HIV-associated inflammation such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors or cocaine use. Other evidence indicates that cocaine is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. It was also shown that cocaine use modifies the effect of HIV on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Supported by DA035632, this research team enrolled 102 daily cocaine users (including 84 HIV-infected) with contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed significant (>50% in diameter) coronary stenosis, and employed a cash- incentive approach to systematically reinforce cocaine abstinence. The study demonstrated that continued cocaine use led to coronary plaque volume progression, while abstinent or reduced cocaine use led to plaque volume regression. However, whether cocaine use influences plaque characteristics in HIV-infected cocaine users has not been investigated. Plaque characteristics are important because rupture-prone coronary plaques might not necessarily be only those, which cause obstructive stenosis, and that HRPFs are independent of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis. However, identification of the strongest predictor of CAD among four HRPFs, the napkin-ring sign (NRS), at present, is based only on expert subjective opinion. A landmark cardiovascular radiomics study calculated 4,440 radiomic features for each coronary plaque and identified a subset of these parameters which predicted NRS, a qualitative feature of prognostic imaging marker of acute coronary syndrome. It is quite possible that with the cardiac radiomic approach, the association between cocaine use and this critical biomarker will be further clarified. The objective of the proposed study is to examine whether cocaine use influences plaque features in HIV-infected cocaine users. The proposed study will perform radiomic analyses on the imaging data from 102 participants on DA035632. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To examine whether continued cocaine use is associated with the NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (2) To examine whether abstinent or reduced cocaine use ameliorated NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (3) To compare NRS and its associated radiomic features between HIV infected and uninfected participants, and (4) To validate the findings generated from this study. The proposed study will convert heart CT images into numeric data, and use artificial intelligence techniques to examine whether continued cocaine use worsens hidden heart disease, and reduced cocaine use slows down hidden heart disease in HIV infected chronic cocaine users.",The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease,9795066,R21DA048780,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cocaine ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Computers ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incentives ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' mortality ', ' Paper ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Chronic ', ' prognostic ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Cocaine Users ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Participant ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 18FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18-FDG ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' Rupture ', ' Abstinence ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' cocaine use ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' radiomics ', ' coronary plaque ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,204688,MD-07,0.01990553087701541
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging

"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches.

"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9692475,R01HS025402,[''],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2019,394737,AZ-06,0.09560781198285526
"Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Drug development and approval is a costly process with nearly $2 billion spent for each drug that is approved. One of the most significant contributors to this high cost is the expense of developing drugs that fail to pass clinical trials – only 15% of drugs that begin clinical trials are approved for use on humans. A common reason for not reaching the FDA’s criteria for approval is that the drug is classified as cardiotoxic, which cannot be detected during early stages of drug development. One way that drugs can lead to cardiotoxicity is by altering the electrical activity of ion channels that are responsible for the excitation of the heart tissue that pumps blood to the body. Understanding which ion channels, and the extent to which these ion channels are affected is central to determining the cardiotoxicity of a drug. Early-stage predictions of cardiotoxicity are based on animal studies that are poor models of human heart behavior or single-cell electrophysiological studies that falsely assume underlying pathophysiology based on action potential changes. The recent development of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offers an opportunity to study drug effects on human cells in a preclinical setting. In this study, we hypothesize that fitting a computational iPSC-CM model to voltage-clamp (VC) data acquired before and after drug application provides a means of quantifying unknown drug effects on specific cardiac ion channels. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) Use machine learning to design a novel VC protocol that improves the quality of data for hiPSC-CM model fitting. 2) Quantify the change in hiPSC-CM ion channel conductances before and after drug application. We will use machine learning to develop a novel voltage clamp protocol that improves the electrophysiology data acquired from our hiPSC-CMs. The data is optimized to improve predictions of the conductances for all ion channels activated during the cardiac action potential. We can apply this voltage clamp protocol in an in vitro setting before and after drug application, then fit our computational model to each dataset. The change in ion channel conductances, predicted by the model fit, serves as an estimate of the channel-specific effects of the drug. The contributions of this proposal will be significant because it will be the first study to use human cardiac cells to produce quantitative measurements of channel-specific drug targets that may lead to lethal cardiac arrhythmias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many promising drugs developed to treat a variety of diseases have undesirable effects on the heart, including increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Often, these drugs are not found to have adverse effects until they reach clinical trials, and failure of drugs at this stage of development is very costly. We aim to develop a method that leverages machine learning and human stem cell-derived heart cells to predict drug cardiotoxicity in a pre-clinical setting to substantially reduce the cost of the drug development process.",Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning,10068266,F31HL154655,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Costs ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Cavia ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Drug Approval ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' blood pump ', ' improved ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Equation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' human data ', ' voltage ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' voltage clamp ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Adverse effects ', ' patch clamp ', ' heart cell ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' human stem cells ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Standard Model ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,39120,NY-23,0.1178255369879451
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Coronary Vessels ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Endothelium ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' indexing ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Microcirculation ', ' Microspheres ', ' Microbeads ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Systole ', ' Testing ', ' Vasodilator Agents ', ' Vasodilating Agent ', ' Vasodilator Drugs ', ' Vasodilators ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Coronary ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' sequence learning ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' high risk ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging based approach ', ' imaging approach ', ' recruit ', ' adverse event risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' Animals ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,CA-28,0.06515916791514959
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10034460,R01HL153447,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' California ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Holter Electrocardiography ', ' Holter Monitoring ', ' Holtmon ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hybrids ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mission ', ' Mitral Valve Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Incompetence ', ' Mitral Insufficiency ', ' Mitral Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Valve Incompetence ', ' Mitral Valve Regurgitation ', ' Mitral Valve Prolapse ', ' Barlows Syndrome ', ' Floppy Mitral Valve ', ' Mitral Click-Murmur Syndrome ', ' Systolic Click-Murmur Syndrome ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Registries ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Ventricular Tachycardia ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators ', ' Implantable Defibrillators ', ' base ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' Defibrillators ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' cardiac fibrosis ', ' myocardial fibrosis ', ' coronary fibrosis ', ' novel ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Validation ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' prognostic significance ', ' Risk stratification ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,810751,CA-12,0.07186214494436995
"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes. This will reveal fundamental concepts of gene regulation and may lead to a better understanding congenital heart defects towards improving diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development,10118056,U01HL157989,"['human pluripotent stem cell ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' deep learning ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' stem cell model ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' CTCF protein ', ' DNA-binding protein CTCF ', ' CCCTC-binding factor ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' cohesin ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' histone modification ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' chromatin modifier ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' SMARCA2 ', ' SMARCA2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' Cardiac development ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' GATA binding protein 4 ', ' GATA4 ', ' GATA4 transcription factor ', ' GATA4 gene ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' heart defect ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' ']",NHLBI,J.

"Outpatient Worsening Heart Failure in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: An Innovative Approach to Characterizing a Novel Clinical Entity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health- related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1) to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record (EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services, implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD.

"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics.

"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,9946858,R01HL151838,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' aortic valve replacement ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Heart Valve Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Diseases ', ' Valvular Heart Disorder ', ' cardiac valve disease ', ' cardiac valve disorder ', ' cardiac valvular disease ', ' degenerative valvular heart disease ', ' heart valve disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Metabolic ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' LVEF ', ' Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ', ' Complex ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' LV remodeling ', ' left ventricle remodeling ', ' Left Ventricular Remodeling ', ' Structure ', ' cardiac dimension ', ' cardiac size ', ' heart dimension ', ' heart size ', ' heart dimension/size ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' valve replacement ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' clinical predictors ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' chronic symptom ', ' persistent symptom ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' proteomic signature ', ' predictive signature ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696226,MA-08,0.11828276729957313
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10052934,R01HL127661,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Sweden ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Schedule ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' QRS Complex ', ' EKG QRS Complex ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Width ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' cardiac resynchronization therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' imaging based approach ', ' imaging approach ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,763531,NJ-06,0.13700910253311588
"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource.

"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations.

"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Awareness ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Motion ', ' Octogenarian ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Utilization Review ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Left Ventricles ', ' Left ventricular structure ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Review Literature ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Collection ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' clinical practice ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' screening ', ' imaging genetics ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' classification algorithm ', ' neural network classifier ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' ']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,MD-07,0.12019178270208504
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Ischemia ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Fostering ', ' Impaired Renal Function ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' magnetic field ', ' cardiac fibrosis ', ' myocardial fibrosis ', ' coronary fibrosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' drinking water ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modeling ', ' patient safety ', ' Heart Muscle tissue ', ' Myocardial tissue ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' individual patient ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' radiomics ', ' Injections ', ' deep learning ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Cardiomyopathy familial hypertrophic ', ' ']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,MA-07,0.0763670118449957
"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,9871771,K23HL150287,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Singapore ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' care delivery ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' cardiac research ', ' Heart Research ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' usability ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' improved outcome ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' readmission rates ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' social factors ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,197243,MA-08,0.061285093971583306
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9995010,K23HL145017,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Flecainide ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Health ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Affect ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ', ' Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy ', ' Cardiomyopathy familial hypertrophic ', ' Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis ', ' Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis ', ' hypertrophic myocardiopathy ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Two-Dimensional Echocardiography ', ' 2-D Echocardiography ', ' 2D Echocardiography ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reading ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' interest ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Myocardial Diseases ', ' Myocardial Disorder ', ' Myocardiopathies ', ' myocardium disease ', ' myocardium disorder ', ' Cardiomyopathies ', ' patient registry ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' clinical care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' clinical imaging ', ' automated image analysis ', ' statistical learning ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,MA-07,0.12339185189243292
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,10163298,R21EB026518,"['Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Doppler Echocardiography ', ' Doppler Study ', ' Elements ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hyperemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Microcirculation ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' pressure ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' Blood flow ', ' diabetic ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' db/db mouse ', ' diabetes mouse model ', ' Diabetic mouse ', ' coronary perfusion ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' ']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,75521,OH-03,0.07897135383258862
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and

"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,9867431,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Heart ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachea ', ' Trachea Proper ', ' windpipe ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Apical ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' fetal diagnosis ', ' Informatics ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' model design ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' learning network ', ' Data Science ', ' Cardiac Abnormalities ', ' Cardiac Malformation ', ' Cardiac defect ', ' Heart Malformation ', ' heart defect ', ' Heart Abnormalities ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' data curation ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' machine learning method ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,806128,CA-12,0.04515429172066087
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,9871727,K08HL150291,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Update ', ' organ procurement transplantation network ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' transplant registry ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' organ allocation ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' simulation software ', ' Risk stratification ', ' transplant centers ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' post-transplant ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2020,157896,IL-01,0.12633223009230424
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,9871208,K23DK123410,"['Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Walking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' fitness ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized strategies ', ' Physical Performance ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' Risk stratification ', ' recruit ', ' Wait Time ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' comparative effectiveness trial ', ' Accreditation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,166536,CA-18,0.06919583142815035
"The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease ABSTRACT Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals living with HIV experience an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although increased arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG-PET was shown to be associated with high risk plaque features (HRPFs) in those with HIV and subclinical atherosclerosis, there is no evidence of increased arterial inflammation in optimally treated HIV-infected adults with full viral suppression, low cardiovascular risk and no known CAD when the imaging results are compared to those from HIV- uninfected controls. These findings suggest that HIV-associated atherosclerosis may be triggered by factors other than HIV-associated inflammation such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors or cocaine use. Other evidence indicates that cocaine is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. It was also shown that cocaine use modifies the effect of HIV on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Supported by DA035632, this research team enrolled 102 daily cocaine users (including 84 HIV-infected) with contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed significant (>50% in diameter) coronary stenosis, and employed a cash- incentive approach to systematically reinforce cocaine abstinence. The study demonstrated that continued cocaine use led to coronary plaque volume progression, while abstinent or reduced cocaine use led to plaque volume regression. However, whether cocaine use influences plaque characteristics in HIV-infected cocaine users has not been investigated. Plaque characteristics are important because rupture-prone coronary plaques might not necessarily be only those, which cause obstructive stenosis, and that HRPFs are independent of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis. However, identification of the strongest predictor of CAD among four HRPFs, the napkin-ring sign (NRS), at present, is based only on expert subjective opinion. A landmark cardiovascular radiomics study calculated 4,440 radiomic features for each coronary plaque and identified a subset of these parameters which predicted NRS, a qualitative feature of prognostic imaging marker of acute coronary syndrome. It is quite possible that with the cardiac radiomic approach, the association between cocaine use and this critical biomarker will be further clarified. The objective of the proposed study is to examine whether cocaine use influences plaque features in HIV-infected cocaine users. The proposed study will perform radiomic analyses on the imaging data from 102 participants on DA035632. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To examine whether continued cocaine use is associated with the NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (2) To examine whether abstinent or reduced cocaine use ameliorated NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (3) To compare NRS and its associated radiomic features between HIV infected and uninfected participants, and (4) To validate the findings generated from this study. The proposed study will convert heart CT images into numeric data, and use artificial intelligence techniques to examine whether continued cocaine use worsens hidden heart disease, and reduced cocaine use slows down hidden heart disease in HIV infected chronic cocaine users.",The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease,10148238,R21DA048780,"['imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' radiomics ', ' coronary plaque ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cocaine ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incentives ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' mortality ', ' Paper ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Chronic ', ' prognostic ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Cocaine Users ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Participant ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' 18-FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18FDG ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Rupture ', ' Abstinence ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' cocaine use ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' imaging marker ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,231750,MD-07,0.01990553087701541
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' frail older adult ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' functional status ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' Medicare claim ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' screening ', ' signal processing ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' clinical decision support ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' random forest ', ' Data Scientist ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,TX-09,0.07474128964317106
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Dementia and Heart Failure in the Community In response to PA-17-089, we propose exploratory analyses with an existing epidemiologic heart failure (HF) cohort linked to electronic health record (EHR) data to address the combined burden of coexisting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and HF. We will capitalize on the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) and apply novel data science methods to existing community datasets. Recent adverse trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are due to a major increase in HF deaths, and the uncontrolled epidemic of HF compromises progress against CVD. Addressing the epidemic of HF, a disease of aging populations, requires understanding how coexisting conditions interact with HF to impact outcomes and health care utilization. AD/ADRD occupies a distinct position within coexisting conditions as HF increases the risk of AD/ADRD, in part, via shared pathways. However, this association and, in particular, which phenotype of the heterogeneous HF syndrome is associated with AD/ADRD is not well known. AD/ADRD can adversely impact the outcomes of HF, a serious chronic disease that requires effective self-management and cognitive skills.  Yet, how AD/ADRD impacts health care utilization and outcomes in HF is not well understood. These knowledge gaps can be addressed by secondary analyses of existing data. Our objectives are to study, in an epidemiological cohort, the characteristics of HF that impart a higher risk of AD/ADRD, and the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes (death, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations and admission to skilled nursing facility). Our proposal directly addresses key points of the PA, such as “Effects of specific combinations of two or more comorbid conditions on risks for specific adverse health outcomes, impact of specific combinations of two or more chronic conditions, …interactions among disease processes, and health outcomes in complex older patients with multiple chronic conditions.” This work will capitalize on a large epidemiological HF cohort linked to comprehensive EHR data within the rich environment of the REP, optimally suited to our proposed secondary analyses. This proposal leverages the experience of our team with the epidemiology of HF and with novel data science methods readily applicable to secondary analyses of existing EHR data sets. Aim 1 will apply machine learning to discover HF phenotypes associated with AD/ADRD while considering cardiac function, occurrence of atrial fibrillation and other coexisting conditions. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of AD/ADRD on outcomes of HF. Conducting this work in a cohort within a geographically defined population and extensive longitudinal follow up will ensure that our results reflect the experience of community patients with HF. An improved understanding of the coexistence of AD/ADRD and HF will establish the prevalence of this association in the community and characterize the type of HF associated with AD/ADRD, which may allow earlier diagnosis, thereby enabling interventions to prevent or forestall early disease. Finally, improving our knowledge of how AD/ADRD affects outcomes will foster more precise management.

"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health.

"International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction Summary Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue. Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,9977674,R01HL146754,"['Adult ', '

"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,9972190,R01HD098458,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Association Learning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cytogenetics ', ' Respiratory Diaphragm ', ' Diaphragm ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Endocardium ', ' Endothelium ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Hernia ', ' Diaphragmatic Hernia ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Syndrome ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' dosage ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' biochip ', ' genome database ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' WNT4 ', ' Wingless-Type MMTV Integration Site Family, Member 4 ', ' WNT4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Clinical Data ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' Chromosomal microdeletion ', ' microdeletion ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' malformation ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' web based interface ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Cardiac development ', ' GATA binding protein 4 ', ' GATA4 ', ' GATA4 transcription factor ', ' GATA4 gene ', ' SOX7 ', ' SRY-Box 7 ', ' SOX7 gene ', ' septum defect ', ' septal defect ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,457528,TX-09,0.08840571338809397
"Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac Studies and Drug Development Project Summary Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase II grant with University of California Irvine is to provide novel systems to assess cardiac electrophysiology in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Heart disease plagues the world as the leading cause of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmic diseases alone contributed about 350,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Although causative genes for some of them have been partially discovered, genetic basis for the majority remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Dario rerio) model system is an important vertebrate experimental model owing to its small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, amenable and conserved genetics, and optical transparency. Zebrafish have long been used as model system for understanding human cardiac development, disease, and regeneration. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Owing to the physiological similarities to humans’, zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal model system for drug screening. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves anesthesia causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. Further, data processing and analysis have been done manually, making it impossible to conduct large-scale studies. In this context, we propose to establish a long-term roadmap using multidisciplinary approaches to enable i) novel devices and systems to provide reliable ECG data of multiple fish (both adult fish and larvae) over a long period of time; ii) cloud-based systems to effectively process and interpret as well as study large-scale data; and iii) a host of cardiac studies as well as drug investigations using the zebrafish models and our novel tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase II SBIR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of California Irvine will develop novel bioengineering tools to collect and study electrocardiogram of the zebrafish model with high throughput. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based acquisition and analytics in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous cardiac studies and drug screening applications.

"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,10015326,R01HL135557,"['Algorithms ', '

"Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors. Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body. Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure data. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing devices will be developed using new core technology for the internet of medical things. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to allow communication between the different implantable elements and recharge those same elements allowing for miniaturization. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of the heart failure patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Enabling

"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,9961660,R01HL146739,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' branched amino acids ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Atlases ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obese Mice ', ' ob/ob mouse ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Woman ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' insight ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' empowered ', ' Fatty Acid Metabolism Pathway ', ' fatty acid metabolism ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Catabolism ', ' Proteome ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Symptoms ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Molecular Target ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' protein function ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' constriction ', ' anti-oxidant enzyme ', ' antioxidant enzyme ', ' Data Science ', ' preservation ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' knowledge graph ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,649707,CA-33,0.12749766125221143
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population. Our project aims to uncover medication-related risk factors for sudden cardiac death and develop clinical decision support tools that will promote safer medication prescribing.",QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis,9943546,R01HL152034,"['Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Potassium ', ' K element ', ' Publishing ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators ', ' Implantable Defibrillators ', ' base ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' SSRI ', ' SSRIs ', ' Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ', ' serotonin reuptake inhibitor ', ' Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Location ', ' Risk-Benefit Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' case control ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' support tools ', ' Data Analytics ', ' structural cardiac abnormality ', ' structural cardiac anomaly ', ' structural cardiac defect ', ' structural heart condition ', ' structural heart defect ', ' structural heart disease ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized decision ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' medication safety ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Antiemetics ', ' Anti-emetics ', ' Antiemetic Agents ', ' Antiemetic Drugs ', ' anti-emetic agents ', ' anti-emetic drugs ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,606842,NC-04,0.05051364554806296

At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction score for imminent SCD in those that have warning signs, in order to improve the effectiveness of SCD prevention.",Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs,9916644,R01HL147358,"['Affect ', ' Archives ', ' California ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sudden Death ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Palpitations ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Syncope ', ' Fainting ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Proteomics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Catchment Area ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' community living ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' clinical risk ', ' Patient Triage ', ' 911 call ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' common symptom ', ' circulating markers ', ' circulating biomarkers ', ' Risk stratification ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,816401,CA-28,0.02370376487566272
"Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data, organized by Drs. Mansoor Husain, Benoit G. Bruneau and Marc Pfeffer. The conference will be held in Keystone, Colorado from March 1-5, 2020. Heart failure is global health problem of increasing prevalence, high morbidity, and refractory mortality, for which there have been relatively few impactful therapeutic advances. This unique multidisciplinary conference will bring together leading clinicians and scientists to share the latest insights on genetic, environmental, iatrogenic and pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure. The program includes specific sessions and workshops focused on advances in cardiac fibrosis, immunology, metabolism, regenerative medicine, biomedical engineering, and analytical approaches to large datasets of relevance to this disease. Although the program is diverse, each session will address a scientific frontier in heart failure biology of potential therapeutic relevance and will be framed to address an unanswered, important clinical question. This innovative format is purposefully planned to highlight translational opportunities in heart failure and to provide a forum that encourages dialogue between cardiovascular researchers and trainees with distinct perspectives, but who share a common goal of making an impact in heart failure. This conference will be paired with “New Insights into the Biology of Exercise.” These two Keystone Symposia conferences will share a joint session examining exercise physiology and how it affects cardiac energetics and hypertrophy, which will be of interest to audiences attending either conference. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure is global health problem of increasing prevalence, high morbidity, and refractory mortality, for which there have been relatively few impactful therapeutic advances. However, the larger question of heart failure disease and its underlying mechanisms has resulted in a lack of effective therapies for a patient population which is increasing in size, age and clinical complexity.

"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9939641,R01HL148248,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Clinico-Pathologic Conference ', ' Clinico-Pathological Conference ', ' clinical conference ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Source Code ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical risk ', ' health data ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' race bias ', ' racial bias ', ' ethnic bias ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' minority communities ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' stroke model ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' thromboembolic stroke ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' heterogenous data ', ' ']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,681289,NY-12,-0.019609754286036736
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9847997,K23HL135274,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Investments ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' professor ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' preempt ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' digital ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' Theory of Change ', ' Data Science ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' big biomedical data ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' advanced analytics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,203397,CA-12,0.1460079250374683
"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality.

"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,9839658,R01HL144157,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Automation ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Fluorocarbons ', ' Perfluorocarbons ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Engineering ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incubators ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' NADH ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' insight ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Viral ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' cardiac metabolism ', ' heart metabolism ', ' voltage ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' high throughput technology ', ' functional genomics ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics ', ' cardiac electrophysiology ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques ', ' drug discovery ', ' heart cell ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nano carrier ', ' nanocarrier ', ' transcriptomics ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' stem cell technology ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' biophysical model ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' engineered heart tissue ', ' cardiac tissue engineering ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,706471,DC-98,0.09285565271348635
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9987573,R01CA225446,"['Appointment ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Ownership ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Interdisciplinary Communication ', ' Cross-Disciplinary Communication ', ' Multidisciplinary Communication ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' computer science ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' heart development ', ' heart formation ', ' cardiogenesis ', ' Institution ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Metathesaurus ', ' Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus ', ' UMLS Metathesaurus ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' illness perceptions ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' natural language ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood flow ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic field ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' magnetohydrodynamic ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,CA-28,0.011369861672172087
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Arteries ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Atheroma ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' Future ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' Measurement ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Cardiac Death ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' novel ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' patient registry ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Rupture ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' high risk ', ' coronary computed tomography angiography ', ' arm ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' individual patient ', ' prognostic significance ', ' coronary artery calcium scoring ', ' coronary calcium scoring ', ' coronary plaque ', ' coronary event ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,CA-28,0.0941387808336416
"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of High Risk Coronary Plaque Although current practice focuses largely on the detection and management of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), there is marked heterogeneity in the relationship between CAD and risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Some patients, despite having obstructive CAD, do not experience cardiovascular events, while others with non-obstructive CAD do. The mechanisms of this high risk coronary plaque (HRCP) development are incompletely understood; application of emerging imaging and molecular technologies holds great promise for simultaneously identifying underlying biological pathways, markers for early noninvasive detection, and novel therapeutic targets for HRCP. Thus, we propose to (1) determine the role of inflammation and other candidate biological pathways in the pathophysiology of HRCP; (2) identify novel biological pathways mediating development of HRCP through machine learning analyses of integrated metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling; and (3) determine the incremental prognostic value of these imaging and molecular biomarkers over clinical factors and create an integrated clinico-molecular model of CV event risk prediction. We will accomplish these goals by, for the first time, integrating advanced CTA-based phenotyping of HRCP with molecular profiling and adjudicated CV events, leveraging the robust, existing resources of a large, unique NIH-funded clinical trial of imaging in chest pain patients (PROMISE). This proposal holds great public health significance by augmenting current population- and ischemia- based approaches and more precisely and preemptively identifying those patients at highest risk. Our findings will provide a critical foundation for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics targeted at specific, culprit atherosclerotic phenotypes and molecular pathways. Patients who develop blockages in the arteries around their hearts (termed coronary artery disease or CAD) often suffer from heart attacks and death due to these blockages. However, some patients who do not have significant CAD also suffer from these events. These patients are felt to have likely had “vulnerable” or “high risk” coronary plaque (HRCP). We do not understand well what types of patients develop HRCP or the biology as to why some patients develop HRCP. In this grant, we will analyze data on patients with and without HRCP (identified through a CT scan) who were enrolled in the PROMISE clinical trial to understand which patients develop HRCP and then analyze the blood from these patients.

"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9921462,R01HL141989,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Ventricular Fibrillation ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' sudden cardiac death ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' cardiac electrical activity ', ' heart electrical activity ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' functional genomics ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics ', ' cardiac electrophysiology ', ' Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Molecular ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' endophenotype ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' phenotypic data ', ' GTEx ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' TOPMed ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' causal variant ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,476969,WA-07,0.09725477435344271
"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10030978,R01HL153146,"['absorption ', ' Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Gold ', ' Heart ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Coronary Angiography ', ' Catheters ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' heart function ', ' Coronary Artery Stenosis ', ' Coronary Stenosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Slice ', ' Preparation ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,504903,MN-05,0.050571842782525606
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', '
