"mHealth-based Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Physical Activity Levels of Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary The lack of regular physical activity (PA) in over 290,000 individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States (US) is an ongoing health crisis. This lack of activity has potentially devastating consequences because low levels of PA in people with SCI elevates the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and lung disease. Furthermore, low levels of PA in individuals with SCI have been associated with secondary conditions such as pain, fatigue, weight gain, and deconditioning. Regular PA and exercise-based interventions have been linked with improved outcomes and healthier lifestyles among those with SCI. Sensor- based activity monitors can assess PA and exercise interventions by quantifying wheelchair movement, movement of the individual, and physiological changes. However, these monitors do not provide real-time, tailored feedback and recommendations that might help individuals with SCI increase their PA levels in the community. The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate a sensor-enabled, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) strategy to increase and sustain PA levels among individuals with SCI in their communities. The long-term goal of this research is to effectively integrate a mobile health JITAI with existing PA intervention programs to motivate health-related behavior change in individuals with SCI. A primary objective of this proposal is to extend our pilot work to evaluate the integration of a JITAI with a web-based 14-week PA intervention program from the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the integration of web-based PA intervention program with JITAI will result in significantly higher PA levels over 14 weeks compared to the standard we-based PA intervention program alone. A secondary objective of this study is to extend existing algorithms that use commercial wearable technology to robustly detect PA behaviors to facilitate the delivery of tailored just-in-time actionable feedback and PA recommendations for individuals with SCI (Aims 3 and 4). The integration of the JITAI, which provides feedback and PA recommendations due to sensor-based assessments of PA, with the standard web-based PA intervention program will be tested via a clinical trial that combines a randomized controlled trial and a micro-randomized trial. Our team includes investigators with expertise in SCI research, mobile health, PA tracking, and behavioral change interventions. The proposed study will yield novel insights about JITAIs and JITAIs combined with more traditional, web-based PA intervention programs, which will help researchers design engaging PA interventions for individuals with disability in the community that may improve their health and quality of life.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Anaphylaxis ', ' Anaphylactic Reaction ', ' Anaphylactic Shock ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Diet therapy ', ' dietary therapy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergic to food ', ' Allergy to food ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Milk ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Urticaria ', ' Hives ', ' Measures ', ' Milk Hypersensitivity ', ' Milk Allergy ', ' allergic to milk ', ' allergy to milk ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Funding ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' phase III protocol ', ' Exposure to ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' Egg Hypersensitivity ', ' allergic to eggs ', ' egg allergy ', ' Allergy to eggs ', ' Groundnut Hypersensitivity ', ' Peanut Hypersensitivity ', ' allergic to peanuts ', ' peanut allergy ', ' Allergy to peanuts ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Allergic ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' food allergen ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' oral diagnostics ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' neglect ', ' desensitization ', ' analytical tool ', ' egg ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' allergic response ', ' allergen response ', ' allergy response ', ' T cell response ', ' food challenge ', ' oral immunotherapy ', ' screening ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning network ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' immunotherapy trials ', ' intervention cost ', ' data tools ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1745202,NY-13
"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Persons ', ' Terminology ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' Intercept ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Health Promotion Sciences ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Diet Monitoring ', ' dietary monitoring ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Consumption ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' analytical tool ', ' Health behavior change ', ' effective intervention ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' control theory ', ' rate of change ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' relapse risk ', ' intervention cost ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' Cardiometabolic Disease ', ' Cardiometabolic Disorder ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240,IL-07
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,10224739,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly ', '

"Population Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) causes frequent and severe infections in hospitalized patients. In addition, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant PA is increasing and is now between 15-30% in many areas. Thus, it is not surprising that the IDSA, WHO, and the CDC have each listed PA as serious public health priority in need of new therapeutic agents. An age-old question concerning PA is why some strains cause substantially more aggressive infections than others. The recent application of next generation sequencing platforms to this problem has begun to provide an explanation by demonstrating that PA genomes differ substantially from strain to strain. Approximately 10-15% of the genes in a typical PA strain are ""accessory,"" meaning that they are present in some strains but not others. Likewise, the ""core"" or conserved genome contains numerous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion-deletions (indels). Although a few of these accessory genes and core alleles have been characterized and shown to modulate virulence, they represent the ""tip of the iceberg."" A systematic examination of strain-to-strain differences in PA is likely to uncover a wealth of novel virulence-impacting genes and alleles. Identification of these would have several important consequences: (i) They would dramatically enhance our understanding of PA virulence and the mechanisms by which this bacterium causes severe disease; and (ii) they would allow one to predict the virulence of PA strains based on the complement of accessory and core virulence genes/alleles that were present in their genomes.  We hypothesize that application of comparative genomic approaches to large numbers of PA isolates will identify novel virulence genes/alleles and allow the generation of machine learning models to predict the virulence of PA isolates based on their genomes. We will perform the following specific aims to test these hypotheses: (1) Use machine learning models to predict the virulence of PA isolates based upon their genomic content. (2) Identify accessory genes and core genome SNVs/indels that play a causal role in virulence. (3) Develop a genome-based model that predicts clinical outcomes in patients with PA bloodstream infections. The impact of this proposal is twofold. First, it will lay the foundation for future models that provide valuable prognostic information to clinicians treating PA-infected patients. Second, it will identify new PA virulence factors that mediate novel pathogenic mechanisms of infection. The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes frequent and difficult to treat infections. Strains of P. aeruginosa differ markedly in the severity of disease that they cause. We propose to use a comparative genomic approach to understand the bases for these differences.",Population Analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence,10367782,R01AI118257,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lethal Dose 50 ', ' LD-50 ', ' LD50 ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Moths ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Virulence ', ' Waxes ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' public health priorities ', ' comparative genomics ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' MDR P aeruginosa ', ' MDR P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' sequencing platform ', ' gene product ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection ', ' P. aeruginosa infection ', ' infected with P. aeruginosa ', ' infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' ']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,549727,IL-07
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,10126727,R01CA215318,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ankle ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Tarsus ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Exercise ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Patients ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Physical assessment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical Function ', ' respiratory ', ' functional group ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' population movement ', ' Impairment ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' standard measure ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' doubly-labeled water ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' advanced analytics ', ' algorithm training ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,475626,WI-04
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",10083209,U24DK112331,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Budgets ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Transducers ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Activity ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Rat Strains ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' web page ', ' webpage ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' methylome ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' gene product ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' data resource ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2021,3992994,NY-13
