"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,10140308,U01CA238475,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant

"The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology. ABSTRACT: African-American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European-American (EA) women. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disparity is a critical unmet need with major public health implications. The tumor immune milieu may play a pivotal role in breast cancer disparities, specifically tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that have roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Using H&E stained slides from a large epidemiological case-control study, we have discovered that AA women have significantly higher levels of TILs than EA women – especially in the estrogen receptor (ER) negative subgroups. This indicates a distinct biological difference in the tumor immune response related to race and ER status, and also presents a conundrum in which TILs that are often associated with better outcome are higher in AA women, who typically fare worse with breast cancer. These findings indicate that the specific composition of immune cell populations and their spatial arrangement within the tumor environment are likely to be important mitigating factors for the role of TILs in breast cancer progression, and tumor differences between AA and EA women. Our preliminary data from the NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel support this idea by revealing that AA women have gene expression signatures indicative of higher levels of exhausted T cells than EA women, which have a diminished capacity to destroy tumor cells, consistent with the poorer survival observed in AA women. Here, immune gene expression profiles also varied by ER status, pointing to a potential immunoregulatory role of ER in breast cancer.  To date, most studies that examine TILs do so in cohorts of predominantly EA women and in-depth immune profiling studies in large cohorts of AA women are lacking. To address this shortcoming, we will employ multispectral staining and imaging with the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology System to delineate immune cell populations and ER expression in 996 breast cancer samples from the Women's Circle of Health Study. Building on our preliminary data, we propose to evaluate two immunofluorescence panels, each with multiple biomarkers in their spatio-morphological context. While both panels will include ER and a differentiating cytokeratin marker, panel 1 will include four common T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3), and panel 2 will include markers of T cell exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3, PD-1) that may play a key role in the differential immune response between AA and EA women. Our proposal involves the full implementation of a new generation of biomarker assessment techniques – multiplexed staining, multispectral imaging, automated scoring, and digital spatial analyses. A thorough comparison of the immune landscape in breast tumors in regards to race and ER expression will inform our understanding of immune escape mechanisms, and how these processes differ by ancestry. This will be critical for designing immunotherapy strategies that will equally benefit AA women, serving to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European- American women and this may be due to biological differences in their tumor immune cells. We will use a sophisticated tumor tissue staining and imaging approach to evaluate the immune cells in breast cancer samples from a large group of predominantly African-American women. Our findings will inform on the abundance and types of immune cells present in breast tumors and may improve cancer immunotherapy strategies for African-American women.",The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating

"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",10075243,R37CA240403,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computers ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' International ', ' Community Practice ', ' Seminal ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' cloud based ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' deep learning ', ' long short term memory ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2021,528811,WA-07
"Long noncoding RNA regulations in breast cancer among African-American women ABSTRACT Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide, high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype- specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome- wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) African American (AA) women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer and have the highest mortality rate among all racial groups in U.S. women. We will systematically elucidate the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory molecules, in breast cancer prognosis in AA women.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER,10222593,R00CA218667,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Eosin ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients. Over 200,000 older women develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer each year. We will examine whether the symptoms patients have even prior to treatments are related to completing five years of necessary estrogen-blocking breast cancer medications. This study will provide new information about whether preexisting symptoms and/or other factors are important barriers to patients, information that is essential to developing new ways to support patients in taking their medications.",Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women,10261485,R21AG064875,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arthralgia ', ' Joint Pain ', ' Attention ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Interview ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Thermometers ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' post-menopausal ', ' postmenopausal ', ' Distress ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Androstenedione Aromatase Inhibitor ', ' Estrogen Synthase Inhibitor ', ' Estrogen Synthetase Inhibitor ', ' Aromatase Inhibitors ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' pill ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' NCCN ', ' National Comprehensive Cancer Network ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Vasomotor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' older women ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer therapy ', ' symptom cluster ', ' secondary analysis ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' side effect ', ' regression trees ', ' adjuvant endocrine therapy ', ' poor sleep ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2021,195000,WI-05
"Predicting the Likelihood of Immune-related Adverse Events in Breast Cancer Patients ABSTRACT Immuno-oncology agents have clearly improved rates of response in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. However, these improvements come at a cost -- 10-25% of patients will experience an immune-related adverse event (irAEs). These AEs do not appear to be associated with response and appear idiosyncratic. Adrenal insufficiency, for example, can appear late when patients are extremely symptomatic and have a cortisol near zero that can lead fatality if improperly treated. The ability to identify individual patients or subsets of patients who are at increased or high risk of these toxicities will improve outcomes and reduce harm in several ways. Those at highest risk may avoid treatment with certain immunotherapies, while those at increased risk could be flagged for closer monitoring or placed upon prophylactic interventions to avoid or downgrade the AE. The use of demographic, biologic and genetic information in this way is in keeping with precision oncology efforts. The cancer-focused question we are addressing is whether we can predict the likelihood of individuals experiencing serious immune-related adverse events following cancer immunotherapy using age, comorbidities, electronic health record (EHR) data, quality of life (QOL), adverse events (AE), and genetic variations. We hypothesize that early insight into which patients will experience irAEs can be generated by predictive analytics embedded within a decision-support framework. The overall goals of this proposal are to: (1) decipher early which patients are going to experience thyroid disease, pneumonitis, pruritus, colitis, hepatoxicity, or adrenal failure and ultimately affect quality of life; and (2) better understand the genetic profile that underlies patients' risk of developing irAEs. We will use a rich multidimensional data from the I-SPY2 trial in early breast cancer. Due to its adaptive platform design, I-SPY2 provides the opportunity to study multiple immunotherapies within in the same study, using standard methodologies across multiple sites. We propose to: 1) develop and evaluate a holistic approach and resulting decision support algorithm, designed for clinician-researchers who help manage the care of patients undergoing immunotherapy, 2) determine both novel and annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with irAEs, and 3) validate the decision support algorithm in two new experimental arms. Our computational models will be trained on information from 500 I-SPY2 breast cancer trial patients undergoing immunotherapy. Successful completion of this work will increase our understanding of the clinical, patient-reported, and genetic factors underlying irAEs and enable early prediction of who is at risk before therapy is initiated. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop computational tools to predict the likelihood that patients on immunotherapy will experience immune-related adverse events using clinical, genomics, and patient-reported outcomes data; the tools will be evaluated for an adaptive breast cancer clinical trial and can be applicable to other trials.",Predicting the Likelihood of Immune-related Adverse

"Evolutionary dynamics and microenvironmental determinants of metastatic breast cancer Abstract/Project Summary Metastatic breast cancer and relapse following therapy are dependent on (1) development of intrinsic resistance to targeted and endocrine therapies, and (2) resistance to recognition and destruction of cancer cells by the immune system. The Stanford Breast Metastasis Center (SBMC) is focused on (1) quantifying the timing of metastatic dissemination in breast cancer (2) functionally delineating the contribution of cellular and microenvironmental crosstalk on metastatic proclivity, and (3) characterizing the mechanisms of responses by metastatic cells to therapies.  In order to achieve these goals, mechanistic computational models that capture dynamic and emergent tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic properties are needed as are clinically annotated longitudinal tissue cohorts and experimental models that capture disease heterogeneity. The SBMC addresses each of these outstanding challenges. First, we have established an unparalleled collection of clinically annotated breast cancer cohorts sampled through treatment and metastasis, including both prospective and retrospective longitudinal cohorts, with multiple metastatic sites. We leverage a living biobank of breast cancer patient- derived organoids (PDOs) from primary tumors and metastases that recapitulate the heterogeneity of disease, high-risk of relapse subgroups and tumor-immune interactions and greatly facilitating the proposed functional studies. We characterize these vast tissue resources and model systems using state-of-the-art molecular profiling technologies to probe tumor tissue in situ at single cell and subcellular resolution. Specifically, with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging (MALDI) we simultaneously visualize the composition, lineage, function and spatial distribution of tumor and stromal cell populations and perform co-registered analysis of the glycome. We integrate these data within the genomic landscape of metastatic disease and analyze these data within robust machine learning and computational frameworks to uncover disease dynamics and features associated with clinical outcomes. Lastly, we conduct genome-scale CRISPR screens in 3D breast cancer models to systematically define oncogenic dependencies, therapeutic vulnerabilities and macrophage-tumor cell interactions.  This integrated systems biology and functional genomics approach will contribute to a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of metastatic breast cancer and the dynamic relationship between tumor cells and the host, with implications for therapeutic targeting.

"Immunoengineering Next-Generation Cancer Therapies with Focused Ultrasound Project Abstract Metastatic breast cancer (BrCa) is the 2nd most prevalent cause of cancer mortality in women in the United States, with a 5-year overall survival of only 22%. Though cancer immunotherapies are capable of generating durable responses across a variety of cancer types, immunologic rejection of BrCa is rare and spontaneous regression unusual. Thus, there exists a strong precedent for allied combinatorial therapy paradigms that potentiate immunotherapy (ITx) by boosting tumor immunogenicity and/or curbing immunosuppressive mechanisms. In this proposal, we will systematically assess the capacity of focused ultrasound (FUS) - a technique for non-invasive, non-ionizing acoustic energy deposition into tumors – to potentiate adaptive immunity against BrCa metastases and synergize with selected immunotherapies. UVA is a world leader in FUS ITx research, with two “first-in-human” clinical trials underway to evaluate combinations of FUS with PD1 blockade in solid tumors (including metastatic BrCa) and a third trial pending approval to evaluate FUS and gemcitabine for immune-mediated control of BrCa tumors. These trials are accompanied by a companion imaging trial designed to evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration in patients’ tumor deposits via PET/CT, an approach that will also be integrated into our pre-clinical studies. To this end, this proposal leverages these clinical trials as well as a robust pre-clinical program to fortify a highly translational research pipeline rooted in the domains of immunology, molecular imaging, liquid biopsy and radiogenomics. With this toolkit, we intend to design and implement FUS+ITx combinations that offer the potential for quantum improvements in metastatic BrCa therapy. This is achieved in three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand on intriguing early clinical and pre-clinical findings to identify FUS regimens that, when combined with myeloid-targeted therapies, augment the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy against primary and disseminated BrCa tumors (e.g. brain metastases). In Specific Aim 2, we will engineer FUS-based theranostic technologies for liquid biopsy in BrCa in order to (i) discover novel biomarkers of response to FUS and ITx (ii) enable liquid biopsy in settings with low basal levels of circulating tumor biomarkers. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will construct machine learning frameworks that integrate radiological data with genomic data from liquid biopsy specimens (e.g. radiogenomics) to advance BrCa precision care with FUS and ITx. The highly innovate aims of this proposal lend to a systematic approach for advancing the role of FUS in CAR T cell therapy, cancer biomarker discovery and personalized ITx, thereby promising to improve the lives of metastatic breast cancer patients. Project Narrative For the significant fraction of metastatic breast cancer patients that are yet unable to realize the unparalleled benefits of cancer immunotherapy, focused ultrasound (FUS) is poised to play a transformative role - owing to its diverse capacity for destroying solid tumor tissue, enhancing drug delivery and promoting anti-tumor immune response. The goal of this proposal is to design and deploy rational combinations of FUS and immunotherapy in primary and disseminated breast cancers (with special emphasis on CAR T cell therapy), as well as to develop non-invasive tools for monitoring and individualizing these combinations through the use of innovative approaches in molecular imaging, liquid biopsy and radiogenomics. The highly translational structure of this proposal offers the potential for quantum improvements in metastatic breast cancer prognosis and therapy and meanwhile ushers FUS into the burgeoning era of

"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,10206069,K08CA241365,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Indolent ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Slide ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' Histopathology ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' skills ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' cost ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' clinical implementation ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' random forest ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' complex data ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' clinical center ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2021,260112,MA-08
"Identifying responders to chemotherapy in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: development of a multivariable clinical prediction tool Project Summary/Abstract  Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent breast cancer, which is the most common malignancy affecting women in the United States. Although ILC has unique molecular and clinical features, it is not well-studied, and no specific therapeutic strategies exist for it. One of the major challenges in the treatment of women with ILC is determining whether cytotoxic chemotherapy should be utilized or not. Currently available gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype and Mammaprint tests) classify the majority of ILC tumors as molecularly “low risk,” which suggests that cytotoxic chemotherapy will be ineffective. However, ILC is more likely than other types of breast cancer to present at advanced stages with lymph node involvement, making these patients clinically “high risk.” This “clinical high risk” status drives chemotherapy use in patients with ILC, despite discordant results from molecular assays. Indeed, the majority of node-positive ILC patients receive chemotherapy, despite the absence of data suggesting benefit for any individual patient. There is a huge need to improve patient selection, so that chemotherapy can be utilized only in patients who will benefit from it, while others can be spared its toxic side effects. In parallel, for patients with predicted poor response to standard chemotherapy, we need personalized approaches that target the unique molecular pathways involved in ILC. There have been recent advances in our understanding of ILC, and several groups have now identified ILC specific gene signatures that show significant heterogeneity within this group of tumors. Given this newly available data, we can now start incorporating ILC specific tools into clinical practice and develop tailored treatment strategies for women with ILC. In this proposal, I will address this via the following three approaches. First, I will evaluate a novel early indicator of chemotherapy responsiveness in ILC, improving our ability to determine whether a tumor has responded or not. Given the relatively small numbers of ILC patients in clinical trials, I will conduct a pooled analysis using 12 combined datasets from breast cancer patients treated with pre-operative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Second, I will leverage the recent discovery of ILC- specific gene expression signatures and the data available in the I-SPY2 Trial to develop a predictive tool to identify chemotherapy responders (Chemotherapy in Lobular breast cancer Effectiveness and Response [CLEAR] score). Finally, I will conduct a pilot study testing a novel, targeted agent in combination with endocrine therapy in the I-SPY2 Trial, through a new arm termed the Endocrine Optimization Pathway. This project addresses an important, relevant clinical issue, utilizes new datasets and molecular signatures not previously available, and importantly, will allow me to develop skills and knowledge in a mentored setting that will facilitate my ability to design and conduct prospective clinical trials for women with ILC. Project Narrative By conventional measures, women with estrogen receptor positive invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) have poor responses to standard treatment approaches. Given the poor outcomes seen in patients with ILC, there is a great need to improve patient selection for standard chemotherapy and identify novel treatment strategies. In this project, I will develop a new clinical prediction tool to identify chemotherapy responders, and conduct a pilot trial testing a novel agent for estrogen receptor positive tumors.",Identifying

"Lesion Composition and Quantitative Imaging Analysis on Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract. Women with dense breast have not been shown to benefit by increased cancer detection of volumetric digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) but may benefit by lower recall rates. DBT screening biopsy rates are similar to 2D digital mammography; higher for first screening exams, lower thereafter with adjustment for age and breast density. In the U.S., 71% of biopsies do not result in a breast cancer diagnosis among women ages 40-79 who undergo breast cancer screening. To address the high rate of unnecessary biopsies, an innovative way to use FDA-approved breast imaging protocols has been developed to acquire multispectral images to measure the lipid/water/protein (L/W/P) composition of suspicious breast lesions. Malignant breast tissue has unique L/W/P composition fractions when compared to normal or benign breast tissue. This proposal aims to increase biopsy yield (BI-RADS-PPV3) through combining L/W/P biological biomarkers with quantitative morphological and textural image analysis. This combination of composition and physical descriptions of suspicious breast lesions is called q3CB. The benefits of adding q3CB to the current DBT screening/diagnostic imaging paradigm, that may already include computer aided detection, is not known. This study is designed to compare the expected biopsy yield with and without q3CB in a clinical reader study and explore how q3CB may be combine with existing technologies. The central hypothesis is that biological L/W/P fractions in breast tissue in combination with analysis of morphological and textural tissue characteristics will yield significantly higher breast cancer specificity than conventional interpretation of DBT alone. The objective is to better identify suspicious breast lesions that need to be biopsied for malignancy in women currently recommended for biopsy. The long-term goal is to reduce unnecessary biopsies and increase biopsy yield. Our rationale for the proposed research is that biological L/W/P descriptions of breast lesions will lead to more specific biopsy decisions and a better understanding of cancer types. Specifically, the project aims are 1) develop q3CB lesion signatures for distinguishing breast cancer lesions from benign lesions, using 600 prospectively-acquired DBT exams of women recommended to undergo biopsy; 2) conduct a clinical reader study to compare radiologists' performance on standard-of-care FFDM or DBT without and with the inclusion of q3CB signatures; 3) Investigate the utility of q3CB lesion signatures in a screening paradigm to improve sensitivity and specificity on CADe-identified suspicious lesions in the tasks of assessing malignancy as well as in associating with their association with cancer subtypes; Exploratory) explore the added sensitivity and specificity of dual-energy DBT in phantom studies that explore lesion size, composition, and breast density. The innovation of this study is the full characterization of lipid/water/protein lesion composition with DBT and how it complements existing computer aided diagnostic programs paired with clinical radiologists providing evidence ready for clinical translation of this unique and emerging technology. Project Narrative. The proposed studies are relevant to public health because they have the potential to increase the effectiveness of diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis. Thus, this advance is expected to have a high impact to the health and well being of women because mammography and tomosynthesis are currently the primary diagnostic tools for early breast cancer detection, and over two-thirds of women diagnosed through these imaging modes do not have cancer, resulting in many unnecessary painful invasive procedures.

"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,10109103,R21CA245597,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Biochemical ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain ', ' Brain Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Brain ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Brain ', ' brain micrometastasis ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' brain cell ', ' cancer complication ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' migration ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' translational approach ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' operation ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' Breast cancer metastasis ', ' Breast Metastasis ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' histological slides ', ' histologic slides ', ' Clinical stratification ', ' pathology imaging ', ' organ on a chip ', ' organ on chip ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' in-vitro diagnostics ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,182325,MI-12
"SCH: Leverage clinical knowledge to augment deep learning analysis of breast images Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have achieved remarkable success in medical image-based applications. Today, there are unprecedented needs in developing novel strategies and methodologies to enable robust, trustworthy, and accessible AI for various applications. Classic deep learning training is driven purely by data. In the medical domain, clinical knowledge is often available and useful, but is mostly ignored in the current practice of AI research. Incorporating clinical knowledge into deep learning modeling requires an in-depth understanding of medical context/workflow. This calls for multi-disciplinary collaborative research using computational techniques and clinical sciences to advance the biomedical data/AI research. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new paradigm of deep learning that combines imaging data and clinical knowledge to augment breast cancer diagnosis, risk assessment, and lesion detection. We will develop technical innovations on breast imaging to address deep learning modeling on small datasets, longitudinal examinations, and content-efficient images, through three specific aims: Aim 1: Formulate auxiliary tasks/assessment into model training of CNNs for breast cancer diagnosis on small datasets; Aim 2: Employ biological relationships of images to guide deep learning structure design for breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal data; Aim 3: Develop a knowledge-guided unsupervised pipeline for identification of a suspicion map to support deep learning analysis on content-efficient images. These aims represent novel applied methodological development to build roust deep learning models for important clinical imaging applications. We have strong preliminary results for each aim and an experienced research team covering computational, biomedical, engineering, and clinical sciences.

"Comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment to predict patient response to immunotherapy Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and there are few available treatment options for patients with this disease. Recently, immunotherapy has shown promise in a subset of TNBC patients. However, identifying which patients will benefit from immunotherapy is currently extremely challenging. In order to understand why certain patients respond to immunotherapy and others do not, we need to develop a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is made up of cancer cells, as well as the immune and stromal cells which surround them. Previous work has demonstrated that changes in the relative abundance of certain cell types in the TME can predict whether patients will respond to treatment. However, we have lacked the tools to develop a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of interaction between the different cells in the TME. For the F99 phase of this proposal, I will combine multiplexed imaging with exome sequencing to comprehensively profile the TME in TNBC patients. I will analyze 100 TNBC patient samples from a clinical trial testing the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. I will first link genetic alterations to changes in the localization of cells in the TME, to increase our understanding of the relationship between cancer genetics and host cell infiltration. I will then use these relationships to generate biomarkers of response to immunotherapy. For the K00 phase of this proposal, I will develop an organoid model of the TNBC TME. Using this organoid model, I will determine how the absence of myeloid cells alters the phenotype of the organoid. I will then use single-cell sequencing to identify the transcriptional changes that myeloid cells undergo following treatment with anti-PD-1. This fellowship will provide me with the necessary training in both computational analysis and experimental methods to lead my own group studying the interaction between the immune system and cancer. This project will provide significant insight into the mechanisms of response and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. By developing better biomarkers of response, this work will help to inform clinical care and may guide clinical trial design testing our findings. Identifying the transcriptional changes following anti-PD-1 treatment will generate novel hypotheses for the creation of new combination treatments, influencing subsequent therapeutic development.",Comprehensive profiling of the tumor microenvironment to predict patient response to immunotherapy,10304556,F99CA264307,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering /

"Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis Abstract: In early breast carcinogenesis, neoplastic cells grow in multiple layers towards the lumens of ducts, which subjects the periluminal cells to harsh conditions of low oxygen, low pH, and nutrient deprivation. Adaptation to these harsh conditions is a pre-requisite for survival of incipient tumor cells. Adaptations are initially acute and reversible, but eventually Darwinian selection results in cells with hardwired phenotypes. A prominent example of this is aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg Effect (WE), wherein cells are hard-wired to ferment glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. Notably, a WE is highly correlated with a cancer’s metastatic potential and poor outcome. Hence, a major question in carcinogenesis is: “What are the mechanisms by which a harsh microenvironment eventually selects for hard-wired (heritable) phenotypes, such as a WE?”. Rather than simply selection of pre-existing phenotypes, we contend that the microenvironment actively induces phenotypic diversity through a systematic set of epigenetic and genetic alterations.  To address this question, we combine preliminary data from three different approaches that are all focused on the eco-evolutionary dynamics occurring during carcinogenesis: In the first, we have subjected benign breast cancer and epithelial cells to harsh conditions encountered in DCIS and have observed that the cells that survive these selections exhibit a WE. We selected three clones and applied single cell RNA sequencing and single cell ATAQ sequencing as well as whole exome sequencing to map the transcriptome, epigenome, and mutation patterns of the selected clones compared to their parental normal cells. This will form the model system to be analyzed throughout the current proposal. In the second line of investigation, we have documented the profound epigenetic changes that occur during progression of multiple myeloma (MM) from pre-malignant to metabolically active disease. We hypothesize that these observations in MM can provide a framework to predict and interpret the changes that breast cancer cells undergo as they transition from a benign non-glycolytic to an aggressive glycolytic state. In the third line of investigation, we have outlined a continuum starting with epigenetic changes and show how these result in permanent mutational or chromosomal changes. This latter work provides a framework with which to predict and interpret how microenvironment-induced epigenetic changes can eventually lead to hardwired genetic changes that are observed in aggressive glycolytic breast cancer. By combining these approaches, we propose to decipher the mechanisms whereby microenvironmental stress-induced genome evolution results in hard-wired phenotypic adaptations, represented by a WE.  At the end this study, we expect to have a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the environmentally-induced epigenetic and genetic changes that occur during carcinogenesis, and how these relate to hard-wired phenotypic profiles, as exemplified by the Warburg Effect. Narrative This proposal tries to answer a major question in carcinogenesis: “How do harsh microenvironments select for hardwired metabolic phenotypes, such as Warburg Effect, leading to carcinogenesis”? Combining three high technology approaches of cancer evolutionary biology, mathematical modeling, and system biology, we propose to decipher the relationship between microenvironmental stress-induced genome evolution that results in hardwired phenotypic adaptation represented by a WE as an initiator of cancer. Solving this problem will have significance as it is a long-standing problem in cancer biology.",Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis,10273324,U01CA261841,"['O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Proteins ', ' Starvation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Benign ', ' Comedo ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genets ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' stressor ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' transcriptional silencing ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' aerobic glycolysis ', ' novel ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Sampling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' Normal Cell ', ' HK2 ', ' HKII ', ' HXK2 ', ' HK2 gene ', ' In Situ Lesion ', ' Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter ', ' GLUT ', ' GLUT1 ', ' Glucose Transporter 1 ', ' SLC2A1 ', ' Solute Carrier Family 2, Facilitated Glucose Transporter, Member 1 ', ' SLC2A1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Warburg Effect ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' tumorigenic ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' MCF10A cells ', ' MCF-10A ', ' MCF10A ', ' stem ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' epigenome ', ' Breast Epithelial Cells ', ' mammary epithelial cells ', ' Breast Carcinogenesis ', ' nutrient deprivation ', ' nutritional deprivation ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Acidosis ', ' Affect ', ' Aneuploidy ', ' Aneuploid ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Multiple Myeloma ', ' Plasma-Cell Myeloma ', ' myeloma ', ' myelomatosis ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxygen ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (“connectome”) is significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again 1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post- chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient- related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory- motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI and may also help us refine our prediction models. RELEVANCE A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to validate a model for predicting who will develop long-term cognitive impairment and to examine the underlying causes of this impairment. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.",Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment,10124310,R01CA226080,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' falls ', ' Schedule ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Oncologist ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Occupational ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Validation ', ' chemobrain ', ' chemo brain ', ' chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment ', ' chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment ', ' post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' chemotherapy ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' connectome ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,281784,TX-10
"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,10194417,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' TP53 gene ', ' Antioncogene Protein p53 ', ' Cellular Tumor Antigen P53 ', ' Oncoprotein p53 ', ' P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein pp53 ', ' Protein TP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Antigen ', ' p53 Genes ', ' p53 Tumor Suppressor ', ' protein p53 ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' TDLU ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,637416,FL-04
"Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pose continuous and persistent threats to create new metastases albeit at an unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100 times higher metastatic capacity, create more polyclonal metastasis, and correlate with worse prognosis. Our previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted CTC aggregation, identify the drivers of CTC cluster-mediated polyclonal metastasis, and therefore develop proof-of-principle targeting strategies to block lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer, using multiple human PDXs and CTC lines as well as mouse tumor models. The collaborative team includes Dr. Huiping Liu (Northwestern University) with expertise in CTC and cancer stemness, breast oncologist Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (Northwestern University), imaging expert Dr. Constadina Arvanitis (Northwestern University), and bioinformaticist and structural biologist Dr. Yang Shen (Texas A & M). Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women and claims about 40,000 lives in the United States every year. Metastasis account for 90% of breast cancer deaths. In order to develop effective treatments against cancer, we need to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying metastasis. Using clinical specimens, patient-derived xenograft models, and other cell line and models along with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to identify a novel mechanism critical for circulating tumor cell cluster formation and targeting strategies to block metastasis, thereby eventually contributing to a reduced mortality rate of breast cancer.",Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation,10143213,R01CA245699,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibodies ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Aggregation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neoplasm Circulating Cells ', ' circulating neoplastic cell ', ' circulating tumor cell ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Tumor Cell Line ', ' Mediating ', ' Yang ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung ', ' Metastasis to the Lung ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Lung ', ' lung metastasis ', ' metastasize to the lung ', ' pulmonary metastasis ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' CDKN1A gene ', ' CDK-Interacting Protein 1 ', ' CDKN1 ', ' CDKN1A ', ' CIP1 ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1A ', ' WAF1 ', ' Wildtype p53-Activated Fragment 1 ', ' p21 gene ', ' p21 protein ', ' Oncologist ', ' Blocking Antibodies ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' CD44 ', ' MDU3 ', ' Pgp1 ', ' CD44 gene ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Extracellular Domain ', ' External Domain ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' tumorigenic ', ' migration ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' stemness ', ' tumor ', ' MDA MB 231 ', ' MDA-231 ', ' MDA-MB231 ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Breast cancer metastasis ', ' Breast Metastasis ', ' 4T1 ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' Mammospheres ', ' Patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer ', ' Breast PDX models ', ' breast cancer PDX ', ' breast cancer patient-derived xenograft ', ' Breast Oncology ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' lung colonization ', ' colonization associated with lung ', ' colonization in the lung ', ' colonization within the lung ', ' patient derived xenograft model ', ' PDX model ', ' Patient derived xenograft ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,478017,IL-07
"Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening SUMMARY Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date. Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning “from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable in particular to cancers with more limited datasets. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to detect breast cancer as early as possible while limiting the burden of screening in high-risk women. To this end, risk will be estimated from magnetic resonance images of the breast as well as mammograms using deep learning techniques. A retrospective analysis of a very large dataset will determine if some women could have avoided unnecessary scans without missing newly developing cancers.",Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening,10121555,R01CA247910,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Population ', ' Cancerous ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' contrast imaging ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' screening program ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Breast MRI ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data curation ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' TCIA ', ' ']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2021,703284,NY-10
"Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases? PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY It is widely estimated that 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. This statistic underscores our inability to manage cancer once it disseminates through the body, and our need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of cases. Taken as a group, TNBCs pose an unmet clinical challenge in many ways: (1) TNBCs represents the most aggressive and most metastatic subtype of breast cancer, (2) up to 46% of late-stage TNBC patients will develop brain metastases, (3) TNBC patients are at four-times higher risk of developing diffuse metastases on the surface of the brain (leptomeningeal disease), which is rapidly and universally fatal, and 4) women of African ancestry have an up to 80% higher likelihood of developing TNBC – making TNBC a cancer disparity. Previous studies demonstrate that primary TNBC is highly immunogenic, and immune infiltration is associated with improved prognosis. However, little is known about the immune environment in TNBC brain metastases and how tumor-immune interactions effect metastatic potential. Recognizing these pressing issues, I have chosen to focus my career as an independent cancer researcher on using a systems biology approach to uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis and race- specific cancer disparities. A comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan will be executed over the course of the K99 and R00 training period, which will provide me with the necessary tools to make an early transition to independence. First, to visualize tumor-immune interactions, I will construct an in-situ protein map of TNBC brain metastases using MIBI – a cutting-edge multiplexed imaging method (AIM 1). I will use a validated imaging analysis pipeline to quantitate the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor-immune microenvironment and determine the extent to which these features correlate with patient outcomes. In AIM 2, I will identify tumor-immune receptor-ligand pairs using single-cell RNA-sequencing on TNBC brain metastases samples. Lastly, in AIM 3, I will use MIBI to visualize tumor-immune interactions in primary TNBCs to determine whether interactions in the primary tumor microenvironment prime immune system tolerance of disseminated tumor cells enabling brain metastases. I will validate relevant targets by measuring their expression in patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which contains brain-tumor- associated cell-free RNA. The results of my proposed postdoctoral research will positively impact public health as they will reveal key tumor-immune interactions responsible for priming the immune system for metastasis, and will generate the first “TNBC brain metastasis interactome”. My results will lead to the discovery of new molecular targets with the primary goal of reducing metastasis-driven cancer mortality. The K99 career development plan and focused research training will be critical to expand my skillset in biocomputation – a necessary component of my proposed research; as well as fill any gaps in my background, preparing me for a timely and successful transition to the R00 independent phase. Overall, the dual-phase award will significantly enhance my research, and ensure my continued contribution to public health and increasing diversity in science, as an established cancer researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is estimated that metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, with 1 in every 2 advanced staged triple-negative breast cancer patients developing brain metastases – surviving as little as 4.9 months after metastatic diagnosis. This work postulates that the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment reflects distinct tumor-immune interactions that are driven by receptor-ligand pairing; and that these interactions not only impact tumor progression in the brain, but also prime the immune system (early on) to be tolerant of disseminated cancer cells permitting brain metastases. The main goal of this work is to build a model that recapitulates tumor-immune interactions in brain-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and use this model to identify novel druggable targets to improve survival outcomes in patients with devastating brain metastases.",Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain

"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,10159953,K01HL152009,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts. Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy (Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome and how their association differs by race. Elevated expression of the multifunctional transcriptional regulator, Kaiso (ZBTB33) is associated with worse breast cancer survival based on race. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to study a novel breast cancer health disparities cohort to define new functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment that contribute to racially disparate breast cancer outcome.","The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health

"Developing Digital Pathology Biomarkers for Response to Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Project Summary  Although tremendous strides have been made in uncovering the biology of breast cancer, selection of chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer is based predominantly on receptor status and stage. However, numerous other factors are associated with response, including gene expression patterns and tumor genetics, but these are not uniformly available for patients. Hematoxylin and eosin stained pathology is routinely obtained for all patients with breast cancer, and contains a wealth of information beyond grade. For example, the pattern and amount of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes has long been recognized as a predictor of response to chemotherapy, but quantification is challenging.  Deep learning is an emerging discipline with particular promise in the domain of image recognition, wherein models can learn from repeated exposure to sample images to recognize any candidate features of interest. Using deep learning, our group and others have successfully used histology to predict a variety of tumor specific factors linked with response to treatment, including receptor status, gene expression patterns, driver mutations, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. These features can be accurately detected at point of care, without the extended turn-around time and expense associated with specialized molecular testing. We hypothesize that deep learning on histology can identify novel morphologic and spatial features of breast cancer tumors that in turn can predict response to chemotherapy in early breast cancer. We will take advantage of a rich institutional cohort of over 600 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and over 2000 patients with long term survival data to curate a well annotated database suited for deep learning on digital histology. Our patient cohort also features diverse demographics with inclusion of minority patients often underrepresented in public datasets, ensuring applicability of our findings to all patients with breast cancer. We will use this dataset to develop a deep learning histologic biomarker of chemotherapy response in early stage breast cancer. This deep learning biomarker will be compared to standard markers of response to determine if deep learning on histology provides independent predictive value, allowing better identification of candidates for intensification or de-intensification of standard anthracycline and taxane based chemotherapy. Project Narrative Nearly one in eight women will develop a diagnosis of breast cancer over the course of their lifetime, and nearly one in five with early stage disease will receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment. Deep learning on digital histology has the potential to better predict response to treatment than standard histologic analysis, allowing for more personalized selection of treatment

"Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic options for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer Project Summary/Abstract This is an application for a K08 Award to Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin, an Instructor and breast oncologist at Stanford University establishing a career in translational breast cancer genomic research. The Award will support her career development by providing training in clinical trials, biomarker development, and bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic data under the expert mentorship of Dr Christina Curtis, computational and cancer systems biologist, and Dr George Sledge, breast cancer clinical trialist and translational researcher. The proposed research focuses on the major public health problem of metastatic breast cancer, estimated to affect over 150,000 women and to cause over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype. Eight “integrative” subtypes of HR+ breast cancer have been identified based on the integration of genome-wide copy number and expression information in early-stage breast tumors. Four integrative subtypes, together comprising one-quarter of all HR+ early-stage breast cancers, exhibit a very high risk of distant metastasis; each of these subtypes is characterized by a distinct area of the genome that exhibits concomitant copy number gain and overexpression. The studies in this proposal will examine for the first time how integrative subtypes behave after metastasis, with the driving hypothesis that they may derive benefit from personalized therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 is to investigate the biology and impact of integrative subtypes in metastatic HR+ breast cancer. We will develop novel approaches to assess integrative subtypes and will learn whether they change across metastasis, whether they are associated with timing of metastasis, and whether they have differential lengths of response to standard therapies. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effects of a novel combination of targeted therapy in two integrative subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. We will perform a clinical trial that tests a targeted therapeutic approach in tumors classifying as one of two of the four high-risk integrative subtypes. Because these two subtypes are defined by focal areas of genomic alteration involving either the fibroblast growth factor receptor ligand (FGF3; integrative subtype 2) or the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1; integrative subtype 6), we hypothesize that these tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibition. Participants in this trial will receive standard endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition, as well as an investigational agent that inhibits the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway. We will also perform tumor biopsies before and during treatment to evaluate for changes that occur with this combination targeted therapy approach. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the groundwork for continued efforts to develop a precision oncology approach for metastatic HR+ breast cancer, with next steps to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K08 Award. Project Narrative Metastatic breast cancer, of which hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common, is estimated to affect approximately 150,000 women in the United States; most of these women will die of breast cancer, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among women. This proposal will examine distinct molecular categories of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer to understand whether different treatments may affect these groups differently. The knowledge gained will lay the groundwork for a personalized approach to therapy for metastatic breast cancer to improve health and lengthen life.",Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic

"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules. Women in two weight loss interventions changed their behavior overtime. We will assess how the environment around them may have affected their behaviors to inform future studies that use spatial cues to prompt behavior change.","Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",10112098,R01CA204320,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alternative Splicing ', '

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,10411403,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' TP53 gene ', ' Antioncogene Protein p53 ', ' Cellular Tumor Antigen P53 ', ' Oncoprotein p53 ', ' P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein P53 ', ' Phosphoprotein pp53 ', ' Protein TP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Antigen ', ' p53 Genes ', ' p53 Tumor Suppressor ', ' protein p53 ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' TDLU ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,102875,FL-04
"Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon Project Summary/Abstract: As cancer becomes an increasingly important cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, nations must improve their capacity to diagnose and treat the malignancies that most affect their populations. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality for women in Cameroon, where two thirds of patients present with stage III or IV disease, and five-year survival rates are less than 30%. A longstanding collaboration between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles (the MBLA partnership) plans to conduct key stakeholder interviews in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a breast cancer screening program that is initially offered to high-risk women. Risk-based screening aims to equitably target early screening efforts while ensuring that diagnostic and treatment capacity are sufficient to manage lesions identified through screening. Such a program requires a breast cancer risk prediction model that is applicable and acceptable to Cameroonian women and feasible to evaluate through a community-based screening program. Studies in the United States, Asia, and Nigeria demonstrate that breast cancer risk prediction models perform best when they are ethnic group-specific, but no breast cancer risk prediction model has been developed for Cameroonian women. The African Breast Cancer case-control Study (ABCS) contains breast cancer risk factor information for women from Nigeria, Uganda, and a small subset of women from Cameroon. Traditional approaches to risk prediction will likely suffer from small sample size in models trained on Cameroon data only or from bias in models trained and validated on the full, ethnically diverse dataset. In Aim 1, a subgroup-specific cross-validation method will be incorporated into the Super Learner ensemble prediction algorithm to develop a breast cancer risk prediction model that incorporates all ABCS data but is optimized for Cameroonian women. Aim 2 addresses MBLA members’ concerns that certain risk factors from ABCS will be difficult to evaluate by community survey. Targeted learning methods will be used to define metrics for comparing risk prediction models including and excluding these variables so that Cameroonian stakeholders can evaluate whether to include these risk factors in their breast cancer risk prediction model. In Aim 3, an R shiny app will be developed, tested, and optimized in order to facilitate use of a Cameroon-specific breast cancer risk model in a future screening program. The methods developed and tested in this project could help to optimize cancer risk prediction models for other ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of the MBLA collaboration, UC Berkeley’s leaders in the field of targeted learning, and the UCSF Global Cancer Program. By providing protected time for training, research, and career development, this grant will facilitate the applicant’s progress towards becoming a breast surgical oncologist researching methods of improving access to cancer care in Africa. Project Narrative: In response to rising rates of breast cancer in Cameroon, a partnership between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles plans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a risk-based breast cancer screening program in Cameroon. This project aims to develop a method for defining a breast cancer risk prediction model optimized for Cameroonian women that makes use of information from a large, ethnically diverse case-control dataset and to provide Cameroonian stakeholders with information needed to select which risk factors to include in a Cameroon- specific breast cancer risk model.

"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety.
