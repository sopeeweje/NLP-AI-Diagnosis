"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,10159277,R01GM131407,"['Algorithms ', ' Archaea ', ' Archaebacteria ', ' Archaeobacteria ', ' Archaeon ', ' Attention ', ' Bacteria ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Sequence Data ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Training ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' human tissue ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Consult ', ' Performance ', ' identification of viruses ', ' virus identification ', ' trait ', ' virus host interaction ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Genomics ', ' model design ', ' model development ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' microbiome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Coupled ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' metagenomic sequencing ', ' metagenome sequencing ', ' biological research ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' dark matter ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' power analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' microbiome research ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' contig ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,276700,CA-37
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,10129428,R25MH112480,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Habits ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Competence ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' instructor ', ' data management ', ' neurogenetics ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' computer science ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' open source ', ' e-science ', ' escience ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' data visualization ', ' project-based learning ', ' project-based curriculum ', ' summer institute ', ' Data Science ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' classification algorithm ', ' Data Science Core ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' biomedical data science ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2021,206030,WA-07
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10303076,R44GM137622,"['Adoption ', ' Books ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Motion ', ' physical science ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' teacher ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' skills ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Drops ', ' Address ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' R25 Program ', ' Education Projects ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reader ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education ', ' STEM Education ', ' STEM knowledge ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education ', ' science, technology, engineering and math knowledge ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics knowledge ', ' K-12 Education ', ' K-12 classroom ', ' K-12 level ', ' K12 classroom ', ' K12 education ', ' K12 level ', ' reading ability ', ' reading achievement ', ' reading competence ', ' reading proficiency ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' English Learner ', ' English Language Learner ', ' scientific literacy ', ' scientifically literate ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Future Teacher ', ' Preservice teacher ', ' future faculty ', ' pre-service teacher ', ' student teacher ', ' learning community ', ' learning engagement ', ' learning outcome ', ' personalized learning ', ' science teacher ', ' science educator ', ' science professional ', ' adaptive learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,774997,WA-05
"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,10252023,R01GM133848,"['Adoption ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Linear Models ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Galaxy ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Genetic study ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' TOPMed ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' R programming language ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' structured data ', ' computational pipelines ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,414994,WA-07
"Big Data Health Science Fellow Program in Infectious Disease Research Abstract The multiple, massive, and rich Big Data streams in healthcare (e.g., electronic health records, mobile technologies, wearable devices, genomic data) and the emergence of advanced information and computational technologies (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence) offer an invaluable opportunity for applying innovative Big Data science research in NIAID focus areas of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. Big Data science has the potential to identify high-risk individuals and communities and prioritize them for early biomedical or public health interventions, predict long-term clinical outcomes and disease progression, and evaluate public health policy impact. Key to addressing these complexities is a critical mass of health researchers with adequate knowledge, competencies, and skills to unlock important answers from Big Data to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent these diseases and related comorbidities. However, there is a nationwide shortage of talent with such knowledge, competencies, and skills, especially in traditional academic settings. While junior faculty, as part of the generations of digital learners, have the greatest potential to develop their Big Data health science research agenda, many face multiple structural barriers to conduct Big Data science research. Such barriers include a lack of protected time to initiate new interdisciplinary Big Data research, lack of opportunity to participate in funded Big Data research, and a lack of adequate mentoring. To address these gaps, we propose developing a “Big Data Heath Science Fellow” program for early career junior faculty (i.e., assistant professors) at health science schools (e.g., medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy, social work) at the University of South Carolina (USC). Specifically, we plan to recruit 4 USC health science junior faculty per year and provide them with protected time (25%) to participate in the comprehensive training program, including: 1) courses for competency and skill development in Big Data research and professional development; 2) participation in hands-on research and grant proposal development; and 3) rich mentoring experience in Big Data research and professional development. The proposed training program will be implemented with the support of the existing infrastructure of the USC Big Data Health Science Center (BDHSC), one of USC’s Excellence Initiatives. BDHSC’s mission is to promote and support Big Data health science research at USC and across SC through capacity development, academic training, professional development, community engagement, and methodological advancement. BDHSC contains 5 content cores (electronic health records, geospatial, genomic, social media, and bio-nanomaterial data) and 2 supporting hubs (business/entrepreneurship and technology) with the involvement of 43 faculty from 10 USC college/schools. The proposed training will be an integral component of the BDHSC professional development mission. Upon the accomplishment of the proposed training, each trainee will be expected to: 1) obtain hands- on mentored research experience on an NIAID-funded project; 2) develop at least one Big Data-related manuscript on HIV or COVID-19; and 3) submit one grant application to NIAID or other appropriate funding source. The training program will foster a research environment to encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue further Big Data health science research in HIV, COVID-19, and other NIAID focus areas. Public Health Relevance Statement NIH has identified “workforce development” as one of its 5 strategic goals for biomedical data science in the coming decades and has called for integrative training in data-science approaches through curricula and mentored research. This proposed R25 program is designed to address the nationwide shortage of Big Data health science researchers in NIAID focus areas. The training program will target junior faculty in health science disciplines at the University of South Carolina and will foster a research environment to encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue further Big Data health science research in HIV, COVID-19, and other infectious diseases.",Big Data Health Science Fellow Program in Infectious Disease Research,10311679,R25AI164581,"['Academic Training ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Industry ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' South Carolina ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Entrepreneurship ', ' Entrepreneurial Skill ', ' Businesses ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' professor ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' R25 Program ', ' Education Projects ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Infectious Diseases / Laboratory ', ' Infectious Diseases Research ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' digital ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' public health intervention ', ' health data ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer teaching ', ' social media ', ' hands on research ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Workforce Development ', ' Data Science ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' recruit ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' nanobiomaterial ', ' bionanomaterial ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Data Scientist ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' biomedical data science ', ' data streams ', ' big-data science ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R25,2021,350996,SC-06
"International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2021 Project summary  The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of the highest quality, and publications that promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field, with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision, image processing and machine learning for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer- assisted interventions & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.  The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years and reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series also includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and attendees are typically from over 45 countries, with strong student representation (>40% in 2020). The MICCAI 2021 Conference will be held in Strasbourg, France from September 27th to October 1st, 2021. MICCAI 2022 and MICCAI 2023 will be held in Singapore and Vancouver, Canada, respectively. Since 2018, a Mentoring Program is also part of the conference to connect students and early investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of the Women in MICCAI committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student and early investigator travel and registration awards to enhance diversity in conference attendance (including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds) and provide minority groups with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations. Project narrative MICCAI is the premier meeting in the medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted intervention (CAI) communities, having introduced several landmark papers and providing a springboard for young scientists to establish themselves in the field.

"ABCD Course on Reproducible Data Analyses PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ABCD-ReproNim Course (1R25-DA051675) is a collaborative partnership to provide research educational training in reproducible analyses of data from the ABCD Study. The course integrates curriculum from ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation, which is a NIBIB-funded P41 Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) whose vision is to help neuroimaging researchers achieve more reproducible data analysis workflows and outcomes. The ReproNim approach relies on both technical development of readily accessible, user-friendly computational tools and services that can be readily integrated into current research practices, as well as a broad educational outreach about reproducibility to the neuroimaging community at large, including developers as well as applied researchers across basic sciences and clinical disciplines. The current project proposes an administrative supplement to provide dedicated research training on making data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study FAIR (i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and AI/ML (i.e., Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) ready. ML/AI applications have increased relevance in the discovery of biomarkers, predicting intervention outcomes, and integrating information across datasets. However, the knowledge required to perform effective biomedical ML research spans knowledge about data, scientific questions, computing technologies alongside ML/AI platforms and tools. The ABCD-ReproNim AI/ML Course will extend the current training to make trainees aware of the tools, concepts, and caveats for multimodal ML/AI processing of ABCD data. Students will first receive training across a 5-week online course that includes lectures, readings, and ABCD data exercises on topics that include: (1) FAIR for and FAIRness in ML/AI Applications, (2) Core Concepts in ML, (3), Neuroimaging ML, (4) Interpretable/Explainable ML, and (5) Introduction to Deep Learning. Competencies and skills addressed will include training and publishing ML models, organizing and evaluating data for ML applications, and reusing existing models efficiently. Didactic instruction will be followed by a 5-day remote Project Week, where students will apply the skills learned and work towards completion of AI/ML data analysis projects. Success will result in well-trained researchers who are able to apply reproducible AI/ML practices to test generalizability of AI/ML models for cross-sectional and longitudinal prediction across the ABCD dataset.

"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career.

"Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) PROJECT SUMMARY The Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) project has the overall aims of producing new knowledge in regard to the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of conducting data science research, to develop evidence-based, context specific guidance for the conduct and governance of data science initiatives such as DS-I Africa, and to strengthen the culture of responsible data science in Southern Africa. The project will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 is research intensive and will obtain empirical data on key stakeholder views regarding the development of data science guidance to inform governance of DSI-Africa Research Hubs in Southern Africa. This phase will start with conceptual research and normative analysis of the ELSI issues related to data science. Important concepts to explore will include data sovereignty where data protection is balanced with responsible data sharing. Given that digital data is often experienced as intangible and abstract by the lay public, the project will employ crowdsourcing as a form of citizen science to inform the development of innovative educational tools that could be adapted for stakeholder engagement in data science in the DS-I Africa network. Using these tools, we will conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders to ascertain their experiences with ELSI-data science related challenges, gaps in current guidance and their views on procedural and substantive aspects of guidance development in data science governance. Key themes that emerge from the empirical research will underpin our approach to co-creation of guidelines, procedures and policies required in the DS-I Africa consortium. During phase 1, ethics consultants embedded in the Research Hubs will address emerging ELSI concerns. In Phase 2 of this project, we will develop guidance documents informed by phase 1 research and by best practices in international data science research guidance, the limited experience and existing literature to date concerning data science research and governance of data management in Southern Africa. Importantly, such guidance will be informed by the values of solidarity, sharing and mutual benefit - important concepts in Southern African moral frameworks based on communal good. This approach is congruent with health data ecosystems that require different stakeholders to work collaboratively for health innovation. The results of these policy-related activities will be tempered with key concerns and principles identified in our conceptual and empirical work and will provide locally grounded, practical guidance on the ELSI of data science research conducted in the hubs. In Phase 3 of the project, we aim to amplify the impact and enhance the sustainability of our research and governance activities by creating ELSI networks and communication channels focusing on data science in Southern Africa. This will involve establishing an ELSI Data Science Southern African Network (EDSSAN) to respond to evolving ELSI concerns in DS-I Africa Research Hubs beyond the funding period, hosting annual conferences, and leveraging existing local networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE Southern Africa faces numerous public health challenges due to the high prevalence of communicable and non- communicable diseases. For this reason, innovative public health research, such as data science (or ‘big data’) approaches, are crucial to promote population health and reduce health inequality. The Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA) project will explore the ethical, legal and social implications of the Harnessing Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa (DS-I Africa) initiative by conducting empirical, conceptual and normative research, and developing contextualized evidence-based guidance with the overall aim of enhancing the governance of data science research for health promotion in southern Africa.",Research for Ethical Data Science in Southern Africa (REDSSA),10310553,U01MH127704,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Ethical Analysis ', ' Ethical Analyses ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Social Sciences ', ' South Africa ', ' Transfer Agreement ', ' Work ', ' Competence ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Protection ', ' Ethicists ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' commune ', ' Ethics Consultation ', ' Structure ', ' solidarity ', ' Devices ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Project Summaries ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' public trust ', ' public health ethics ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' public health intervention ', ' health data ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' data access ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' deep learning ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' data framework ', ' data literacy ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY TYGERBERG CAMPUS,U01,2021,400000,
"Center for Live Cell Genomics ABSTRACT Center for Live Cell Genomics We will build new methodology and capacity for large-scale, long-term, inexpensive, modular, customizable, shared, Internet-of-Things-controlled, reproducible live cell culture and tissue-based experimental genomics disease models. Tissue models include traditional cell culture as well as organoid and primary tissue explants obtained from surgery or biopsy. Organoid factories supporting tissue growth and maintenance will be integrated with external and on-chip electro-optofluidic analytical modules to become part of an ecosystem that is modeled after open-source software. It will use commodity sensors, cameras, and computers linked in platforms flexibly designed using simple 3D printing, molding, etching and milling techniques potentially available at any institution. This will stimulate rapid innovation in experimental platforms for tissue culture. We will push this technology and use its best-in-class capabilities to make progress in neurodevelopment and pediatric cancer, addressing big questions. What genes contribute most importantly and specifically to human brain development? How do they go wrong in neurodevelopmental disease or brain injury? What specific molecular pathways are disrupted in individual pediatric cancer cases? How can we test pathway-specific treatments in a tissue model specific to each patient? Our education and outreach plans include a training program to develop a diverse and inclusive cohort of undergraduate students trained in genomic science through secondary school and community college outreach as well as coding workshops and research-based laboratory classes for UCSC undergraduates to develop core competencies. Participation in these activities serve as a basis for training graduate students and postdocs in inclusive pedagogy and mentorship. We are also developing a one-stop information hub to form an online community and to share our technology through immersive webinars and tutorials aimed at a broader audience with a range of expertise from the general public to scientists and clinicians at research institutions. Our work will enable significant advances in neuroscience and cancer research and education, stimulate a new open-source culture in cell biology and genomics, and democratize scientific and educational access beyond elite institutions, extending sharing projects like NHGRI ANvIL beyond data and code to include experiments and Internet-connected experimental platforms. Project Narrative We will introduce a new experimental platform paradigm to genomic studies of live cells and tissues that will allow scientists to be more creative, more productive, more collaborative and use fewer resources for their live cell genomics experiments. We will create new platforms that provide living cells growing in realistic 3D cultures that mimic actual tissues in the body and incorporate Internet-based remote control and analysis capabilities. We will deploy this technology to perform new, more robust and more reproducible experiments leading to discoveries in neurodevelopmental disease and cancer.",Center for Live Cell

"THS: Using Twitter and Big Data Analytics to Track and Predict Health Conditions Project Summary/Abstract U.S. health officials are struggling to keep up with information and misinformation related to health conditions, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks affecting communities nationwide. Early warnings about such events can be found in public postings made by citizens using social networks like Twitter. However, the sheer volume of messages posted each day, and the real possibility of false content makes it very difficult to rely on these data for guidance, education, and decision making. Deep learning and big data solutions could be used to tackle this problem by providing the means to collect, classify, and validate these messages, sorting out actionable data from noise. But deep learning models are hard to train and tune, requiring data sets with thousands of examples. Our long-term goal is to understand how to build, deploy, and maintain an integrated and scalable platform to search social media posts and analyze their contents in search for clues about health conditions. In this project, our overall objective is to develop the technology needed to integrate search queries and deep learning models that are run against social media data to detect conversations that can throw clues about emerging topics, determine the intent of the messages (e.g., opinion, advise), and to find and group together individual messages that are similar in content. Our central hypothesis is that we can reduce query time for message search, increase classifier accuracy and precision for health topic detection, and simplify model training and deployment through the use of transfer learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and similarity-search models based on neural networks. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop supervised methods to support accurate message similarity search. We shall use Siamese neural networks to compute a similarity score between tweets and rank them according to this score. In Specific Aim 2 we will implement data augmentation via GANs to improve model training time and accuracy. Our GANs will generate synthetic tweets that are realistic enough to help users produce good training data with less manual effort and yet produce well-trained models. As a proof of concept, we shall harden our existing open-source THS system by adding these capabilities. Our project is novel because THS is the first system of its kind, providing a “social data warehouse” to collect, store, integrate, index, and analyze Twitter data in an open source platform. Its significance stems from the ability to work as a tool to help health officials analyze tweets, visualize data along disease and spatio-temporal attributes, and make predictive analytics, all under one roof. This could have a significant impact on public health disease tracking and response. UPRM is a Hispanic serving institution, with the second largest Hispanic serving engineering school in the U.S. and with 35% female enrollment. This project provides a unique opportunity to train students in social media analysis, big data systems, and machine learning. The success of this project could open new opportunities for UPRM researchers to participate in collaborative NIH proposals with other institutions.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",10083748,R44GM133245,"['K-12 Education ', ' K-12 classroom ', ' K-12 level ', ' K12 classroom ', ' K12 education ', ' K12 level ', ' reading ability ', ' reading achievement ', ' reading competence ', ' reading proficiency ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' English Learner ', ' English Language Learner ', ' scientific literacy ', ' scientifically literate ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' Future Teacher ', ' Preservice teacher ', ' future faculty ', ' pre-service teacher ', ' student teacher ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' learning community ', ' learning engagement ', ' learning outcome ', ' personalized learning ', ' science teacher ', ' science educator ', ' science professional ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' Home ', ' Adoption ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Books ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Gametogenesis ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sperm cell ', ' Sperm ', ' Spermatozoa ', ' zoosperm ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' resource guides ', ' skills ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' R25 Program ', ' Education Projects ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reader ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' egg ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education ', ' STEM Education ', ' STEM knowledge ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education ', ' science, technology, engineering and math knowledge ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics knowledge ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,750000,WA-05
"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs. Marc Suchard (primary) and Kristian Andersen (secondary), Dr. Holbrook will develop open-source, high-performance computing software and apply his statistical computing methodology to the analysis of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic of the Americas, learning key routes of transmission and identifying phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.",Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning,10176406,K25AI153816,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Air ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Americas ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Earthquakes ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Ships ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' statistics ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Schedule ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Viral Physiology ', ' Viral Activity ', ' Viral Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Free Will ', ' response ', ' Herd Immunity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Viral Epidemiology ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' reconstruction ', ' epidemiological model ', ' blind ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Data Science ', ' Zika Virus ', ' ZIKV ', ' zikav ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ZIKA ', ' outbreak prediction ', ' outbreak forecasting ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2021,106467,CA-33
"Super Greedy Trees Project Summary/Abstract We identify critical weaknesses with Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees (CART), a widely used base learner for machine learning of big omic-data analysis, and propose to replace these with a fundamentally different type of base learner we call super greedy trees (SGT's). SGT's cut the space in a fundamentally different manner, resulting in a richer partition structure with provable consistency and superior empirical performance. The project will develop a uniﬁed SGT framework for big data analysis using machine learning including the treatment of time varying covariate survival analysis, unsupervised learning, highly imbalanced data and multivariate regression. The SGT framework will be deployed within scalable and extensible open source software that will allow NIGMS researchers to deploy them to deal with their challenging big data problems.

"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence.

"Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern biomedical research is increasingly quantitative. The next generation of researchers will need an entirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need, the goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a new, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a unique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address NIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators have taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40 trainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day course into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to- instructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced in teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per year (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation, followed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning session will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to progress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants through realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include: Specific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that improves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome), metagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical scientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well as rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a broad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students, including a long-term follow-up to determine students’ confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career trajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross- training, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.

"Howard University Research Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities Principal Investigator/Program Director: John Kwagyan, PhD Project Summary Advances in technologies and computational tools has made it possible to generate and store large, complex, and diverse datasets. The behavioral, biomedical and health research enterprise is increasingly becoming data- intensive and data-driven. As a result, recognizing, understanding, and using big data for behavioral, biomedical, and health related research has become necessary to arrive at best evidence and enhance translation. Applied data science starts with identifying relevant data sources, developing algorithms and/or utilization of existing software tools to access these data and employing advanced data analytical skills for knowledge discovery and dissemination of information. In biomedical and healthcare areas, big data methodology is used in several fields including but not limited to medical imaging studies, drug discovery, genomics, predictive diagnosis and cost effectiveness studies. Data science also allows researchers to assess patient/population heterogeneity, through the integration of large data from published literature and meta-analysis to reach conclusions that can be used to inform clinical practice and guide public health policy. Despite the importance of the emerging field of data science and the recent rapid rise of its use, many minority institutions do not offer specialized training in data science. Moreover, though the approach is highly developed, there are few who possess the necessary skill set in this highly quantitative and technical field and training opportunities are uncommon and there exist disparities in data science expertise. Skill sets in data science, from ethical practices in data collection, use of complex computational and analytic techniques including machine learning, to data visualization and reporting, are particularly critical for advancing the science of minority health and health disparities. To bridge this gap, and address disparities in acquiring data science skills and its applications, we created the Howard University, HU RCMI Virtual Applied Data Science Training Institute, VADSTI. VADSTI, drew faculty with complementary experts in the conduct and application of data science from across different institutions and in partnership with the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy, delivered a well-attended and successful 8-week comprehensive data science training. The ability of behavioral, biomedical and clinical researchers to recognize, and use big data is still limited in minority serving institutions, for various reasons including lack of exposure to relevant databases and knowledge of programming techniques and access to relevant software, tools, and expertise in data analytics. The need for creation of an ecosystem of data science resources and useful tools at minority serving institutions is warranted. The goals of the current application are, (i) to attract, train and engage the next generation of investigators in using advanced analytics and data science methodology with application to large existing minority health and health disparities datasets, (ii) continue to enhance capacity building by promoting and simulating the creation of data science ecosystem at HU.

The ability of minority researchers in the behavioral, biomedical and clinical science to recognize, and use big dataset, however, is limited for various reasons including lack of exposure to relevant databases, knowledge and incorporation of cutting-edge data science tools and capabilities, and expertise in data analytics. The significance of this application is training the next generation of investigators in using data science methodology and its application in minority health and health disparities research, and promoting the creation of data science ecosystem at Howard University.

"Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM Project Summary/ Abstract Prisms of Reality seeks to develop and assess the impact and feasibility of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) learning platform that targets high-leverage pain points in the secondary math and science curriculum to support a more diverse and well-equipped healthcare workforce. Our platform engages students in self-directed scientific inquiry using compelling real world contexts that develop empirical decision-making skills with regards to key issues in public health. In Phase I, we will design an IVR learning module for high school Algebra that emphasizes how mathematical modeling of ultraviolet rays using trigonometric functions can be applied to reason quantitatively about the risks posed by ozone depletion, which led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In the face of ever changing climate change regulations, our module will ensure students are capable of flexibly applying quantitative models in support of policies that advance public health outcomes while improving proficiency on math and science skills that preclude so many from continuing their education in STEM, specifically in the medical fields. There is evidence that IVR increases motivation and engagement, but applications in learning that empirically improve student outcomes have proven to be elusive. Therefore, the development of a pedagogical framework in IVR that leads to enduring understanding and increased achievement will be ground-breaking for STEM teaching and learning. Our platform employs constructivist, gamified narratives that foster “hands on” student discovery and 3D sense-making of natural phenomena and mathematical models tied to public health issues. Through holistic data collection and analytics, our teacher-facing learning management system will track each student’s conceptual progress and provide individualized feedback. If successful, Prisms’ platform will not only transform the student experience and achievement, but will provide a model of how progressive pedagogical practices can be actualized through IVR to yield meaningful student outcomes. To develop the platform, in Phase I Prisms will a) design a robust game-based pedagogical framework that harnesses innovative features unique to VR to cultivate deep conceptual flexibility and abstract reasoning skills based on authentic real world problems; b) explore effective VR functionalities, experience design, and development techniques for high quality implementation using the cost-effective Oculus Quest; c) implement a teacher-facing learning management system that will provide teachers data-driven insights about student learning in order to support individualized feedback and intervention; and d) evaluate productive user experience & empirically measure our platform’s impact on learning outcomes in authentic classroom settings. Project Narrative The goal of our Phase I research is to iteratively design and rigorously evaluate the impact of an immersive virtual reality learning module in demonstrating how mathematical modelling and reasoning can support the implementation of public health policies like the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which mitigated increased rates in skin cancer, cataracts and other genetic damages due to ozone depletion. Students have often been susceptible to the misuse of quantitative models, which our platform will address through immersive opportunities for students to engage with interdisciplinary, real world problems that impact individual and collective health. Ultimately, we aim to empower a diverse and technically versatile healthcare workforce, while ensuring that all students are equipped with the tools necessary to make empirical decisions about the public health issues of today and the future.","Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM",10252740,R43GM142301,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Awareness ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Ultraviolet Rays ', ' Actinic Rays ', ' UV light ', ' UV radiation ', ' UV rays ', ' ultra violet light ', ' ultra violet radiation ', ' ultra violet rays ', ' ultraviolet light ', ' ultraviolet radiation ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Cataract ', ' cataractogenesis ', ' cataractous lenses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' technique development ', ' Drops ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' iterative design ', ' mathematical theory ', ' Mathematical Logic ', ' Mathematical Reasoning ', ' math theory ', ' mathematic theory ', ' mathematics logic ', ' mathematics reasoning ', ' mathematics theory ', ' individualized feedback ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Algebra ', ' Quantitative Reasoning ', ' Geometry ', ' cloud based ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' algebraic concepts ', ' algebraic reasoning ', ' algebraic theory ', ' algebraic thinking ', ' student participation ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' constructivism ', ' constructivist ', ' learning outcome ', ' pedagogy ', ' personalized learning ', ' trigonometry ', ' trigonometric ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' dashboard ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' Visualization ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRISMS OF REALITY INC.,R43,2021,246773,NY-12
"A Novel Device for Training and Evaluating Ultrasound-Guided Procedures In Anesthesia Project Summary The use of ultrasound for interventional guidance has expanded significantly over the past decade and has become an important tool in clinical specialties such as Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine and Sports Medicine. In interventional ultrasound, there are significant challenges introduced by the necessity of simultaneously visualizing the target and the needle with a single B-mode probe, keeping the nondominant hand steady while finding the correct trajectory of the needle in the dominant hand. The resulting alignment problem (probe, instrument, target) is a different skill problem than identifying structures in ultrasound and requires specialized training. Current training systems do not provide suitable information to aid the novice user in developing key hand-eye coordination skills and their retention. For this reason, we propose to design the EDU –comprised of an Interson ultrasound, a tablet computer with guidance software, a CGM Optical Head with tiny video cameras, and a CGM custom nerve block phantom-- as a learning platform for developing key skills in needle acquisition, accuracy of needle placement, and understanding needle-to-ultrasound-plane orientation. The use of tiny video cameras on the ultrasound enable computer algorithms to compute the trajectory differences between an experienced user performing one of the regional blocks and a student’s attempt. The differences between the paths to the target allow some quantification of the skills, which may be helpful in giving feedback to the student during the semester, and perhaps also to develop a benchmark for CME courses. A second aim of this proposal is to study whether learning with needle-guidance software is beneficial to student skill acquisition and/or confidence. This proposal would study a cohort of student registered nurse anesthetists during a semester course teaching five progressively more difficult nerve blocks/procedures. With this novel system, quantifiable metrics can be harnessed to demonstrate whether learning with guidance is helpful, even when the guidance is removed, and whether it can lead to more consistent procedures across students. Using proprietary custom- made phantoms, the progressive difficulty levels of the five procedures can show whether guidance can be more helpful in more difficult blocs or if it can help in all.

"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases.

"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process. Using big data analysis, we are developing a computational method to utilize drug similarity information to predict novel diseases that drugs can treat.",An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning,10112306,F31LM013058,"['Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Institutes ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Voting ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Orphan ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Viagra ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Mind ', ' Consumption ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' drug candidate ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' side effect ', ' multiple data types ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' drug repurposing ', ' repurposing agent ', ' repurposing medication ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2021,46036,NY-12
"Quantitative image analysis to determine the function of selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration PROJECT SUMMARY This Idaho INBRE Administrative Supplement will establish a collaboration between an INBRE-Developmental Research Program Investigator, S Long, and an IDeA co-funded R01 principle investigator, D Mitchell. Dr. Long is a computer scientist with expertise in machine learning and computer-assisted image analyses. Dr. Mitchell is a cell biologist/immunologist with expertise in retinal development/regeneration. The project is titled, ‘Quantitative image analysis to determine the function of selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration’. There are three Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1. Develop a collaboration between the two investigators to enhance both projects and  increase undergraduate student research opportunities.  Specific Aim 2: Determine the requirement for selected microglia-expressed genes in retinal  development and regeneration.  Specific Aim 3: Develop an image analysis pipeline to support zebrafish retinal analyses. Microglia are the resident phagocytes in the central nervous system and engulf and degrade pathogens, apoptotic cells, and debris. In addition, these cells may be involved in retinal degenerative disease, injury, homeostasis, development, regeneration, and/or crosstalk with Müller glia. The Mitchell laboratory did transcriptome analysis of microglia/macrophage populations isolated from regenerating zebrafish retinas. From this, a shortlist of five microglia-expressed genes of interest are identified. Zebrafish mutant lines are, or will be, established for each gene. Real-time live confocal imaging will be done on wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous zebrafish lines to record microglial dynamics in developing or regenerating retinas. The Long laboratory will develop an image analysis pipeline to automate the interpretation of the large datasets from these experiments. The analyses will quantify microglia numbers and morphology, cell death, Müller glial proliferation, hypertrophy, migration of daughter cells, and expression of neural progenitor markers. The machine learning techniques developed by the Long laboratory will relieve the bottleneck and potential biases in analysis of large image datasets from the Mitchell laboratory and allow rapid testing of microglia gene function. Strong preliminary data and investigator expertise indicate that this team will complete the proposed work. The Long-Mitchell collaboration will provide a continuum of research opportunities for students by delivering broadened student research experiences. Dr. Long has the expertise and the environment to propel students into Data Science, a needed complement for modern biological research. Undergraduate students will be supported in both the Long laboratory at the primarily undergraduate institution, Lewis-Clark State College, and the Mitchell laboratory at the research-intensive, University of Idaho. PROJECT NARRATIVE This collaboration expands two projects currently supported by INBRE and an IDeA co-funded R01, into an interdisciplinary effort to probe specific microglia-expressed genes in retinal development and regeneration using computer-assisted image analyses. The investigators bring expertise in molecular biology and computer science, respectively.

"Cancer Prevention and Control (CAPAC) Research Training Program Summary Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States and disproportionately affected by cancer health disparities. Despite this disparity, cancer datasets, specifically for Hispanic populations, are not as available as for other ethnicities. Given the need for cancer health disparities research with a focus on Hispanic health, there is a need for applying Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) approaches in this field, and an urgency on making Hispanics cancer datasets Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) and AI/ML -ready. The Cancer Prevention and Control Research (CAPAC) Training Program of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC), recruits graduate and health professions students for a hands-on summer research experience in PR. This supplement aims to expand the scope of the parent CAPAC training Program and prepare research workforce on 1) the techniques and approaches to manipulate and pre-process Hispanics cancer datasets to make them FAIR and AI/ML ready, and on 2) the available methods for developing ML-based models to analyze these data and create predictive models for cancer diagnosis and treatments with a focus on Hispanic datasets. We will develop an online course based on the data science project lifecycle, which includes four phases: 1) Data Understanding/ Data Pre-processing; 2) Data Wrangling; 3) Model Planning; and 4) Model Building. This 24-hour online asynchronous course will be organized in modules within two components. Component 1 will include the following topics: fundamentals of cancer data types, identifying and understanding cancer datasets, data science concepts and project lifecycles; basic programming concepts; programming with Python; exploring, pre-processing, and conditioning the cancer datasets; performing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) prior to AI/ML modelling. Component 2 will add topics such as: principles of AI/ML; variable correlations and associations; determining datasets for training and testing; supervised and unsupervised ML approaches; classification, regression and ensembles ML-algorithms; familiarizing with ML tools. To develop our course, examples and projects, we will use Hispanics cancer datasets from the US and PR. The course would be voluntary and free for interested participants (capacity of 40 trainees), including CAPAC participants (alumni) and applicants, CAPAC mentors, as well as trainees and research staff from collaborating grants/institutions. Student’s gained skills will be evaluated with quizzes and a final practical project, while the course will be evaluated with the support of the evaluation component of the parent grant. This supplement will impact the development of human resources (e.g. students, researchers, clinicians) from the United States and Puerto Rico with the competencies and skills needed to make FAIR Hispanics cancer datasets and to apply AI/ML approaches for creating ML-based predictive models for cancer.

"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic.  As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to fight against the disease.  This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via a HIPAA compliant secure server to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a secure HIPAA compliant database that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10190370,R01AI127203,"['Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Businesses ', ' Natural History ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nature ', ' Techniques ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' fight against ', ' systems research ', ' patient privacy ', ' Confidentiality of Patient Information ', ' patient confidentiality ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' combat ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Secure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' Data Discovery ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' data warehouse ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' novel coronavirus ', ' CoV emergence ', ' corona virus emergence ', ' coronavirus emergence ', ' emergent CoV ', ' emergent corona virus ', ' emergent coronavirus ', ' emerging CoV ', ' emerging corona virus ', ' emerging coronavirus ', ' nCoV ', ' new CoV ', ' new corona virus ', ' new coronavirus ', ' novel CoV ', ' novel corona virus ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data infrastructure ', ' big-data science ', ' COVID-19 treatment ', ' COVID-19 therapy ', ' COVID19 therapy ', ' COVID19 treatment ', ' SARS-CoV-2 therapy ', ' SARS-CoV-2 treatment ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 therapy ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 treatment ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapy ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 treatment ', ' treat COVID-19 ', ' treat COVID19 ', ' treat SARS-CoV-2 ', ' treat coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' COVID-19 surveillance ', ' COVID19 surveillance ', ' SARS-CoV-2 surveillance ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 surveillance ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 surveillance ', ' COVID-19 patient ', ' COVID infected patient ', ' COVID patient ', ' COVID positive patient ', ' COVID-19 infected patient ', ' COVID-19 positive patient ', ' COVID19 patient ', ' COVID19 positive patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infected patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease patient ', ' coronavirus disease positive patient ', ' coronavirus patient ', ' patient infected with COVID ', ' patient infected with COVID-19 ', ' patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' patient with COVID ', ' patient with COVID-19 ', ' patient with COVID19 ', ' patient with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient with coronavirus disease ', ' patient with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patient ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,626275,SC-06
"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals.

"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision

"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Codon Nucleotides ', ' Codon ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Half-Life ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', "" Baker's Yeast "", "" Brewer's Yeast "", ' S cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein structure function ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein expression ', ' mRNA Degradation ', ' mRNA Transcript Degradation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' ubiquitin ligase ', ' Ubiquitin Ligase Component Gene ', ' Ubiquitin Ligase Gene ', ' Coupling ', ' biophysical model ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246,PA-12
"Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program (COBIP) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the significant human health and disease burden in Africa, no biomedical data science graduate degree programmes in computational omics, clinical informatics and translational research are offered on the continent. To foster research training that will cultivate graduates able to respond with agility to future biomedical data science needs and develop innovative solutions to address African health challenges, formal interdisciplinary training in biomedical data science is needed. Such training opportunities should include: (i) Biomedical data science applied to data from multi-omics and other technologies, such as biomedical imaging, coupled with the ethical, legal and social Implications of these advances; (ii) Fundamental and advanced concepts in machine intelligence and computational paradigms for developing novel approaches for mining large-scale biomedical data; and (iii) Awareness, amongst graduates, of career opportunities within biomedical data science along with how the soft and hard skills gained in the training program could be transferred into a range of biotechnology/biomedical industries and research/professional careers. Motivated by these needs and leveraging the expertise in clinical and translational research as well as biomedical informatics at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), we propose to develop the “Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program” (COBIP) at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. The program will introduce graduate degree programs to train African biomedical data scientists and faculty in rigorous fundamental data science, computational omics, clinical informatics and imaging data science. COBIP will lead to the development of solutions that address the African disease burden and are relevant to global health. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Develop an interdisciplinary data science training program focused on the health and healthcare needs and priorities of Africa; 2) Train faculty with relevant disciplinary backgrounds, from collaborating African institutions, in biomedical data science to support the development of the field across the continent; and 3) Establish COBIP as an international center of excellence in computational omics and biomedical informatics, distributed across African institutions as a collaborative network of faculty, researchers, and students focused on the African health priorities. COBIP will attract cohorts of trainees from diverse backgrounds including mathematics, statistics, informatics, computer sciences, engineering and biomedical sciences. COBIP will provide innovative educational infrastructure and research opportunities as well as links between clinicians, researchers and biomedical industries through placements and internships. COBIP, through its graduates, will have decisive impacts on African biomedical data science research and stimulate diagnostics, therapeutic selection and drug development to support improved human health and healthcare in Africa and globally. NARRATIVE For this Research Training Program, the University of Cape Town will partner with Oregon Health & Science University to provide interdisciplinary training opportunities to develop the next generation of researchers working on aspects of fundamental data science, computational omics and imaging data science. The Training Program will place strong emphasis on training graduate students and faculty from participating African institutions, through a combination of contact and on-line teaching, research projects and internships, to foster biomedical data science research that will build critical capacity in data science and drive the development of innovative solutions to African health challenges.",Computational Omics and Biomedical Informatics Program (COBIP),10319196,U2RTW012131,"['Africa ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mining ', ' Oregon ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' South Africa ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' international center ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' drug development ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Training ', ' faculty development ', ' faculty professional development ', ' instructor training ', ' teacher development ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' training opportunity ', ' Degree program ', ' Data Science ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' clinical imaging ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' biomedical data science ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN,U2R,2021,346157,
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success.

"Cherokee Nation Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) 11 Abstract Major health disparities continue to impact tribal nations, yet a serious shortage of scientists conducting American Indian (AI) health disparities research persists. For several years, Cherokee Nation, the University of Oklahoma (OU) system, and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) have partnered to address this issue by building tribal research capacity through the Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) mechanism. In this cycle of NARCH funding, the partnership among Cherokee Nation, OU, and OMRF continues and, importantly for student career enhancement, expands to include the Oklahoma State University (OSU) system as a key partner for student career enhancement activities. The overall mission of Cherokee NARCH is to develop durable research capacity within the context of an American Indian (AI) tribal nation to address health disparities. To achieve this goal, the five Specific Aims of Cherokee NARCH are: 1. to strengthen administrative infrastructure, including a Leadership Team (LT) and a Tribal-Campus  Advisory Committee (TCAC), that ensures integration of career enhancement, capacity building, and  research activities; 2. to educate the next generation of researchers to engage meaningfully with Cherokee Nation in the  context of tribal research, focusing on undergraduate, graduate and health professions students; 3. to build tribal capacity by developing a set of research codes to govern the conduct of genomic and other  biomedical research predicated on the concept of tribal data sovereignty; 4. to conduct innovative research and pilot research capable of seeding future research projects  performed by researchers seeking to work within the Cherokee Nation setting; and 5. to evaluate activities of the partnership, including monitoring progress of student career enhancement,  capacity building, and research/pilot research projects, and evaluation of the overall Cherokee NARCH program. Cherokee NARCH provides a crucial opportunity to solidify the foundation for tribal capacity in health disparities research. The addition of OSU strengthens Cherokee NARCH by its remarkable success in the education of AI students in scientific and health professions fields, including the advent of the first tribally affiliated medical school in the US. Cherokee NARCH therefore provides an unprecedented environment in which a tribe, two research-intensive universities with large AI student populations (OU and OSU), and a biomedical research foundation (OMRF) will work synergistically to reduce the unacceptable disparities in health that continue to affect AI people. / Narrative American Indian communities suffer disproportionately from a range of health disparities.

"Hawaii Data Science Training for RCMI Researchers Project Summary There is little doubt that biomedical science has become data intensive science. In the last decade, we have witnessed the booming of new biomedical technologies generate massive amounts of bio-data. This massive data includes various types of “omics”-data, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, petabytes of imaging, and so on. It is now feasible to access and mine the massive amount of clinical and phenotypic data. Data science skills involve how to use computational methods and algorithms to analyze, manage, and interpret different types of data, and require interdisciplinary knowledge such as biomedical domain knowledge, computational programming, statistics, and mathematics. Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) funded projects are often conducted in minority institutions and lack sufficient data science skills and data scientist experts to perform data intensive biomedical research. It is therefore essential to train data science skills for RCMI investigators. Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it is difficult for Hawaii-based investigators studying health disparities to travel to the US continent to receive structured data science training and project-focused analytical support and interactive training. Hawaii investigators desperately need local data science trainers. The data science team at John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) University of Hawaii has rich experience in training data science skills to students and different levels of investigators, as well as supporting their data science needs in their research projects. In the proposal, we aim to train RCMI investigators with next generation data science skills. To reach the goal, we plan to accomplish the following aims. Aim 1: Provide education and training of data science-related skills to RCMI Researchers and their collaborators. Aim 2: Enhance collaborations between RCMI -funded researchers and data scientists. In addition to training RCMI investigators and their collaborators in a group in Aim 1, we will also offer individual data science training for investigators to foster collaborations between investigators and our data science experts. Project Narrative In the proposal, we aim to train investigators of Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI), who conduct health disparity research with next generation data science skills. To reach this, we will provide education and training of data science-related skills to RCMI Researchers and their collaborators. We will also conduct individual training to enhance collaborations between RCMI-funded researchers and data scientists.",Hawaii Data Science Training for RCMI Researchers,10452388,U54MD007601,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' burned ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methylation ', ' Pacific Ocean ', ' Pacific waters ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' investigator training ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' Instruction ', ' next generation ', ' Linux ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' Data Science ', ' phenotypic data ', ' petabyte ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' Data Scientist ', ' structured data ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U54,2021,317955,HI-01
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,10251022,K01HD093863,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Cities ', ' Commuting ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demography ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Workplace ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Dependence ', ' Location ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Population Group ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Computational Technique ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' population health ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Data Science ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Child Health ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2021,137416,PA-12
